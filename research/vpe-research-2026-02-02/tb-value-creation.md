# Thoma Bravo Value Creation Playbook at Scale ($10B+ Deals)

*Deep research compiled 2026-02-04*

---

## Executive Summary

Thoma Bravo manages $181B+ in assets, exclusively focused on software. Their playbook is remarkably consistent: acquire market-leading software companies (often at depressed valuations), execute a two-phase transformation (rapid margin improvement → growth acceleration), and exit at 3-5x+ MOIC in 3-7 years. The firm maintains ~80-110 people internally with 25+ operating partners (independent contractors, mostly ex-portfolio company execs).

**Core thesis:** Software companies are often great innovators but poor businesses. TB's value creation comes from turning them into both.

## 1. Concrete Operational Improvements That Drive 3x+ Returns

### Phase 1: Rapid Margin Improvement (First 100 Days)

TB moves fast. Operating partners are "parachuted in" immediately upon closing with playbook-ready plans.

**a) Cost Structure Rationalization (One-Time Event)**
- **Headcount reduction:** Typically 8-20% workforce cut within first 1-3 months
- **Instructure:** ~20% reduction (two rounds: 100 employees pre-close, 150 post-close in May 2020). Entire mobile engineering team eliminated.
- **Qlik:** 8% staff reduction within first month post-close
- **Ellie Mae:** 10%+ workforce reduction, primarily in sales and account management
- Orlando Bravo's philosophy: "Cost-cutting should be one-time events. Eliminate inefficiencies once through restructuring, then focus entirely on profitable growth."

**b) R&D Spend Reduction**
- **This is the biggest lever for engineering leaders to understand**
- **Instructure:** R&D as % of revenue dropped from 32% → 16% (a 50% relative reduction)
- Capitalized Software Development Costs slashed 83% ($27M → $5M)
- Purchased Software went from $1M → $0
- **The pattern:** TB cuts R&D by refocusing on core product, eliminating speculative projects, and killing money-losing side products
  - Instructure killed the Bridge corporate learning platform (an attempt to replicate Canvas success in enterprise)
  - Qlik cut employees far from the product; those close to building/selling/supporting it were retained

**c) Sales & Marketing Rationalization**
- **Instructure:** S&M as % of revenue dropped from 45% → 22%
- Absolute S&M spend actually decreased ($117M → $91M) even as revenue grew 57%
- TB restructures go-to-market: focus sales resources on core business, eliminate redundant channel investments
- **Ellie Mae:** Holden Spaht described "redirecting sales and product resources to the core business" and restructuring the GTM organization

**d) Stock-Based Compensation Restructuring**
- TB consistently slashes SBC as a percentage of revenue:
  - **Instructure:** SBC/revenue dropped from 22% → 6% (54% absolute reduction: $57M → $26M)
  - **Ellie Mae:** SBC per head dropped 44% ($25.5K → $14.3K)
- **Why this matters:** SBC dilutes equity value. By cutting it, TB ensures more value creation accrues to current equity holders (i.e., themselves). This is a hidden value lever that public market investors can't easily replicate.

**e) Real Estate & Infrastructure Consolidation**
- Close offices, consolidate to HQ
- **Instructure:** Closed nearly all U.S. offices outside Salt Lake City HQ (Chicago, Seattle, San Diego, London)
- PPE line items (Computer Equipment, Furniture, Leasehold Improvements) dropped 60-80%

**f) Price Increases**
- TB consistently raises prices 2-3x over the hold period
- **Ellie Mae:** Spaht noted software was "underpriced relative to the value it was delivering" — subscription and transaction fees were increased
- **Adenza:** Prices reportedly increased 2-3x during TB ownership
- **Instructure:** Revenue growth (34%) significantly outpaced customer growth (17%) in 2021, indicating pricing power extraction from existing customers

### Phase 2: Growth Acceleration & Strategic Acquisitions

After the initial cost restructuring, TB pivots to compounding growth:

**a) Buy-and-Build / Add-on Acquisitions**
- **Qlik:** Acquired Talend (data integration), expanding TAM into comprehensive data platform
- **Ellie Mae:** Acquired Capsilon ($350M) for AI-powered mortgage automation, adding ~$20M EBITDA
- **Sophos:** Acquired Secureworks ($859M) to accelerate cybersecurity services
- **Adenza:** Created by merging Axiom + Calypso, combining regulatory process management platforms → sold to Nasdaq for $10.5B
- **InsightSoftware:** Integrated multiple add-on acquisitions into single platform for cost synergies + cross-selling

**b) Business Model Transformation**
- License → SaaS conversion (Qlik's cloud transition was the primary strategic rationale for going private)
- Qlik went private specifically to execute cloud transition "without constant scrutiny of public markets"
- **Dynatrace:** TB carved it out of Compuware and rebuilt it as cloud-native observability platform

**c) Strategic Repositioning**
- **Dynatrace:** Separated from Compuware ($2.4B total), transformed from legacy APM into cloud-native leader. Revenue grew from ~$25M trailing to $450M+. Sold Compuware mainframe business to KKR separately.

## 2. TB's Track Record on $10B+ Software Deals

### Mega-Deal Track Record

| Deal | Entry Value | Exit Value | MOIC | Hold Period | Key Strategy |
|------|-----------|-----------|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Ellie Mae** | $3.7B (2019) | $11.4B (2020) | **4.1x** | 18 months | Cost restructuring + pricing + macro tailwind (low rates) |
| **Dynatrace** | Part of $2.4B Compuware (2014) | ~$20B+ (2021-2024 exit) | **12.5-13.5x** | ~9.5 years | Carveout + cloud-native rebuild + IPO |
| **Adenza** (Axiom+Calypso) | Undisclosed (built via M&A) | $10.5B to Nasdaq (2023) | Undisclosed | Multi-year | Buy-and-build + synergy extraction |
| **Proofpoint** | $12.3B (2021) | Still held | TBD | Ongoing | Cybersecurity consolidation |
| **Qlik** | $3B (2016) | Planning IPO (2024-25) | Est. 3-5x | 8+ years | Cloud transition + Talend acquisition |
| **Sophos** | $3.9B (2020) | Still held | TBD | Ongoing | Secureworks add-on, product expansion |
| **Dayforce** | ~$5B+ (2025) | Still held | TBD | Ongoing | Tracked since 2008, 17 years of relationship |

**Key observations:**
- TB's best returns come from operational transformation + multiple expansion (Dynatrace: 12.5x+, Ellie Mae: 4.1x)
- EBITDA-based returns are often driven entirely by EBITDA growth, not multiple expansion (Ellie Mae sold at lower EBITDA multiple than purchased, but absolute EBITDA exploded)
- TB has ~100 portfolio companies currently; they target 10-15 investments per fund
- Fund XVI targets enterprise values of $2.5B-$13B with investment tickets of $900M-$4B
- **Exit multiples typically based on ARR or ARR+EBITDA combination** (per Mike Hoffmann, TB partner)
- Orlando Bravo: companies now "selling closer to 15x EBITDA" — so you need genuine operational alpha

### Aggregate Performance
- TB returned $13B+ to investors in 2024 alone
- Raised $34.4B in a single fundraise (2024), the largest PE raise that year
- Dynatrace: est. 50% IRR over 9.5 years, ~$8.6B in total proceeds, ~$8B in gains
- Ellie Mae: 217% gross IRR

## 3. What TB Portfolio Company Engineering Leaders Do to Drive Margin Expansion

### The Engineering Leader's Mandate Under TB

**The fundamental shift:** From "build everything" to "build the right things efficiently."

**a) R&D Rationalization**
- Target: R&D as % of revenue from 25-35% → 15-20% (mature product)
- **Instructure example:** R&D went from 32% → 16% of revenue
- **How:** Kill speculative product lines, reduce experimental projects, focus engineering on core platform
- Stop capitalizing software development costs (Instructure: capitalized dev costs dropped from 11% to 1% of revenue)
- This isn't just cutting — it's redirecting: cut the 30% of R&D that isn't delivering revenue impact

**b) Headcount & Talent Mix Optimization**
- Reduce total engineering headcount by 15-25%
- Shift mix toward lower-cost geographies (India, Eastern Europe)
- Reduce layers of management ("flatten the org")
- The retained engineers are those closest to product delivery — the builders, not the coordinators
- **Instructure:** Despite ~20% total company layoffs, the company's customer base grew from 3,000 to 7,000 and revenue grew 57% — proving the cuts were in non-productive areas

**c) Platform Consolidation & Technical Debt**
- Consolidate multiple products onto single platform architecture
- Reduce infrastructure costs (close offices, consolidate data centers, migrate to cloud)
- Kill legacy product lines that drain engineering resources
- **Qlik:** Consolidated around Sense platform, deprecated legacy QlikView investment
- **Dynatrace:** Complete platform rewrite from legacy APM to cloud-native — this was a multi-year bet that paid off massively

**d) Product Focus as Margin Driver**
- Orlando Bravo: "Product quality reveals itself in support metrics. Companies claiming great products but showing low gross margins on support calls are exposing fundamental product weaknesses."
- Engineering leaders are expected to **improve gross margins through product quality** — fewer support tickets, lower support costs, better self-service
- Cloud/SaaS migration reduces delivery costs and improves margins (TB consistently pushes this transition)

**e) AI & Automation**
- Modern TB portfolio companies are expected to leverage AI to reduce engineering headcount needs
- Qlik pivoting to "AI-powered analytics" platform
- Sophos acquired Secureworks for AI-driven security operations
- Engineering leaders must show how AI reduces manual processes both in product and in engineering workflows

**f) KPI-Driven Engineering Management**
- TB operating partners install KPI tracking from day one
- Weekly board meetings (not monthly/quarterly like most public companies)
- Revenue per engineer tracked obsessively ($300K-$500K+ target for mature products)
- Engineering spend benchmarked across TB's ~100 portfolio companies
- Monthly structured board reviews of engineering productivity and roadmap alignment

## 4. Cost Reduction vs. Revenue Growth: The TB Model Split

### The Two-Phase Value Creation Model

TB's model has evolved from pure cost-cutting to a balanced approach, but the sequencing matters:

**Phase 1 (Months 0-12): Cost-Led (~60-70% of early value creation)**
- One-time restructuring drives immediate EBITDA improvement
- Target: Take EBITDA margins from 5-10% → 25-40% within first year
- **Altaroc data:** TB targets companies with ~5-10% EBITDA margins and aims to improve to ~40%
- This phase typically accounts for the majority of value creation in the first 1-2 years

**Phase 2 (Years 1-5+): Growth-Led (~60-70% of total hold period value)**
- Once costs are right-sized, compounding revenue growth becomes the primary driver
- Growth through: pricing power, add-on acquisitions, new product/market expansion, cloud conversion
- Mike Hoffmann (TB partner): "They make money based on compounded earnings over time, and you compound earnings through top line growth"
- "Everyone looks at the growth rate. They're focused on profitable growth, because that's what's going to generate the best returns."

### Quantitative Evidence of the Split

**Instructure (2019 → 2021):**
- Revenue: $258M → $405M (+57%, organic + acquisition)
- Adjusted Operating Margin: -30% → +21% (51 percentage point improvement)
- EBITDA Margin: -28% → +28% (56 percentage point improvement)
- **Split:** ~55% from cost cuts (headcount, SBC, office closures, R&D cuts), ~45% from revenue growth + pricing

**Ellie Mae (2019 → 2020):**
- Revenue growth accelerated from 6% → 50% (macro tailwind + pricing)
- EBITDA margins: 29% → 50%+
- **Split:** Roughly even between margin expansion and revenue growth when measured on revenue multiples; nearly 100% EBITDA growth when measured on EBITDA multiples
- 4.1x MOIC, 217% gross IRR in 18 months

**Dynatrace (2014 → 2024):**
- Revenue: ~$25M → $1.4B+
- EBITDA margins: negative → 30%+
- **Split:** Overwhelmingly revenue growth (56x revenue growth!). Cost discipline enabled but didn't drive the return — platform transformation did
- 12.5-13.5x MOIC, ~50% IRR over 9.5 years

### The Evolved Philosophy (Post-2019)

A TB Operating Partner said in 2019: *"Historically… everything was focused on costs… What's really shifted is that cost isn't enough — you have to get growth, process change, leadership change, and technology improvements."*

**Modern TB split (approximate):**
- **Initial value creation (Year 1):** ~70% cost reduction / 30% revenue optimization
- **Ongoing value creation (Years 2-5):** ~30% continued efficiency / 70% growth initiatives
- **Total hold period attribution:** Roughly 40-50% margin improvement / 50-60% revenue growth + multiple expansion

## 5. Key Takeaways for an Engineering Leader at a TB Portfolio Company

1. **The first 100 days are brutal but finite.** TB executes restructuring fast and then moves on. Engineering leaders who can execute the cut cleanly and maintain team morale through it are the ones who survive and thrive.

2. **TB keeps management teams.** "We've been better than any of our peers at keeping existing management teams in place. You lose at least a year with management turnover." (Chip Virnig, TB). This is an opportunity, not a threat — TB wants you to succeed.

3. **Focus on profitable growth, not just cost cuts.** TB makes money on compounded earnings growth. After the initial restructuring, the expectation shifts to: how do we grow revenue 15-25% annually while maintaining 35-45% EBITDA margins?

4. **R&D efficiency is the top engineering KPI.** Going from 30%+ R&D/revenue to 15-20% while maintaining product quality and growth is the core expectation. This means killing projects ruthlessly, not doing more with less.

5. **Product quality = margin.** Low gross margins from high support costs signal product problems. Engineering that drives self-service, reduces support burden, and improves product reliability directly contributes to margin expansion.

6. **AI is the new lever.** TB is actively betting on AI across its portfolio (Qlik, Sophos, Darktrace). Engineering leaders who can credibly show how AI reduces headcount needs while improving product will be highly valued.

7. **You will be benchmarked.** TB has ~100 software companies in its portfolio. Your engineering metrics will be compared against all of them. Revenue per engineer, R&D as % of revenue, time-to-production — all tracked and benchmarked.

8. **SBC gets cut dramatically.** Expect stock-based comp to drop 40-50% per head. This is non-negotiable for TB's equity model. The counter: if the exit is 3-5x, even reduced equity stakes can be very lucrative.
