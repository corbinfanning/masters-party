# Strategic Landscape — Updated Feb 4, 2026
*For Corbin — integrating tonight's conversations*

---

## Your Position (The Full Picture)

**Who you are:** Corbin Fanning, transitioning from leading all of ForeFlight Engineering (iOS, Server, Web) → leading Flight Deck backend services & web apps within Jeppesen ForeFlight.

**The entity:** Jeppesen ForeFlight, acquired by Thoma Bravo from Boeing for $10.55B (announced April 2025, closed November 12, 2025).

**Your equity:** $3M targeted profits interests at 3x MoM return. 50/50 time-based / performance-based vesting over ~4 years. Classified as profits interests (capital gains treatment expected).

**Your new scope:** Jeppesen Ground Controls, Jeppesen FliteBrief, ForeFlight backend services (excluding platform/infra/DevOps/IAM), ForeFlight Web.

**Key relationships:** Very close with CPO and your boss (who reports to CPO). Boss consults you on personnel and equity decisions for colleagues. High trust.

## The Role Change — Is It a Demotion?

### The Case That It's Not:
- **Scope is still significant.** You're running multiple product lines across two legacy brands (Jeppesen + ForeFlight). This is a real P&L-adjacent leadership role.
- **You're gaining focus.** Going from "all of engineering" to a defined product domain means you can actually *execute* instead of being spread across everything.
- **You're getting away from product team friction** — you said you're happy about this. That matters. Energy > title.
- **Your boss still consults you on personnel and equity.** That's influence without the overhead. You're a trusted advisor, not a sidelined player.
- **Hands-on work.** You said you want to be more hands-on. This enables that. In PE, the people who understand the systems and can ship are more valuable than the people who manage meetings.

### The Case That It Could Hurt:
- **External optics.** If you ever leave, going from "Head of All Engineering" to "Head of Backend Services" *could* look like a step down on a resume. Framing matters.
- **Equity risk.** If performance-based vesting is tied to company-wide metrics, you have less direct control over those outcomes with a narrower scope.
- **Visibility.** Broader roles have more visibility with the PE sponsors. If Thoma Bravo only sees the CPO and CTO, and your boss is the buffer, you need to make sure your wins are visible.
- **Re-org risk.** PE firms restructure frequently. A narrower role is easier to consolidate or eliminate in the next re-org.

### The Honest Answer:
**It's not a demotion if you play it right.** The risk isn't the role change — it's whether you let yourself become invisible. Your relationship with the CPO and your boss is your insurance policy. Keep that strong. Make sure your delivery is visible. And frame this externally (LinkedIn, etc.) as "leading Flight Deck engineering" — nobody needs to know the internal org chart specifics.

## The Equity — Scenarios & Tax Reality

### The Math at Different Exit Multiples:

| Scenario | TB Exit Multiple | Your Equity Value | After Tax (~23.8%) | After Tax (~40.8% if ordinary) |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------|
| Home run | 4x ($42.2B) | ~$4M+ | ~$3.05M | ~$2.37M |
| Target | 3x ($31.65B) | $3M | ~$2.29M | ~$1.78M |
| Decent | 2x ($21.1B) | ~$1.5M | ~$1.14M | ~$889K |
| Break even | 1x ($10.55B) | **$0** | $0 | $0 |
| Below | <1x | **$0** | $0 | $0 |

### Critical Tax Issue: 83(b) Election
- **Window:** 30 days from transaction close (Nov 12, 2025) → **closed ~Dec 12, 2025**
- **Status:** Not filed. Window has passed.
- **Impact:** Without 83(b), you're relying on IRS Rev. Proc. 93-27/2001-43 safe harbor for profits interests. If the safe harbor holds (likely, given Thoma Bravo's legal sophistication), you still get capital gains treatment. If it doesn't, vesting events could be taxed as ordinary income (~40.8% effective vs ~23.8%).
- **ACTION REQUIRED:** Consult a PE tax attorney this week. This is a potential $500K+ difference.

### Missing Plan Documents
- You received the equity letter Aug 26, 2025
- Deal closed Nov 12, 2025
- **No follow-up documentation received in 3 months**
- The letter promised "formal plan documentation outlining the full terms and conditions after the transaction closes"
- **ACTION REQUIRED:** Email HR/legal this week asking for plan documents

## How Well Positioned is Jeppesen ForeFlight? (AI Disruption Analysis)

### Why You're Protected:
1. **Regulatory moat** — FAA/EASA certified aviation software. Can't replace with AI-generated code.
2. **Data monopoly** — Jeppesen has near-exclusive aeronautical navigation data relationships worldwide. Decades of contracts.
3. **Safety-critical** — Lives depend on this software. Airlines won't swap to AI alternatives.
4. **Switching costs** — Fleet-wide deployments, pilot training, avionics integration. Extremely sticky.
5. **Growing market** — More flights, more pilots, more business aviation globally.

### What the Software Selloff Means for You:
- iShares Software ETF (IGV) down 5% today, 28% from highs — AI disruption fears
- **This is about commodity software** (CRMs, project management, internal tools). Not aviation.
- Nobody is prompting an LLM to generate IFR approach plates or flight planning algorithms.
- **Your company is in the "beneficiary" category** — AI can help you build faster, not replace what you sell.

### The Real Risk to Your Payout:
- **Not AI disruption.** It's PE execution math.
- Can Thoma Bravo 3x a $10.55B investment in 3-5 years?
- Their playbook: consolidate (Jeppesen + ForeFlight + AerData + OzRunways), cut costs, raise prices, expand margins, exit at higher multiple.
- Macro environment for software M&A in 2028-2030 matters. If multiples compress broadly, even good companies exit lower.

## Exit Scenarios (How You Get Paid)

| Exit Path | Likelihood | Timeline | For You |
|-----------|-----------|----------|---------|
| Sale to another PE firm | ~40% | 2028-2030 | Clean cash at close |
| IPO | ~30% | 2028-2030 | Shares + lockup (90-180 days). Price volatility risk. |
| Strategic acquisition | ~25% | 2027-2030 | Cash deal. Honeywell, L3Harris, Garmin possible buyers. |
| Dividend recap | Possible interim | 2027+ | Partial liquidity before full exit. Depends on waterfall. |

## Thought Experiments — Stress-Testing Your Position

### Thought Pattern 1: "What if I optimize for the payout?"
- Stay. Execute. Ship. Keep your head down for 3-5 years.
- Focus on the performance metrics that drive your vesting (2026 financial targets are the first gate).
- Build strong relationships with TB operating partners — they influence restructuring decisions.
- **Risk:** You spend 3-5 years in a role that drains you, collect your money, and then what? Is that the trade you want?

### Thought Pattern 2: "What if I optimize for career growth?"
- Use the new role to become the person who *actually understands the systems*. That's rare at the leadership level.
- Build a reputation as the person who modernized Jeppesen's backend while others just managed headcount.
- Position yourself for CTO/VP Eng at the next company with a story: "I took legacy aviation systems and made them modern during a PE transition."
- **Risk:** Career growth opportunities might require leaving before full vesting. What's the unvested equity you'd walk away from?

### Thought Pattern 3: "What if Thoma Bravo doesn't hit 3x?"
- At 2x, you're looking at ~$1.5M pre-tax (~$1.14M after tax). Still good money, but not life-changing.
- At 1x, your profits interests are worth $0. You worked 3-5 years for salary only.
- **Question:** Are you making decisions based on the $3M being guaranteed? Because it's not. The performance-based half especially is contingent.
- **Implication:** Don't sacrifice your health, family, or career trajectory for money that might not materialize. Make sure the work itself is worth doing.

### Thought Pattern 4: "What if I leave?"
- Your equity vests over 4 years. Leaving early forfeits unvested portions.
- Year 1 (Nov 2026): 25% time-based vests. Performance tranche 1 vests if 2026 targets hit.
- You'd be walking away from potentially $2M+ in unvested equity.
- **But:** If the role is making you miserable, $2M spread over 3 more years is ~$667K/year. Is that enough to stay somewhere you hate?
- **Counter:** You said you're happy about this change and want to be more hands-on. That's a good sign. Monitor how you feel at 6 months.

### Thought Pattern 5: "What if I build something on the side?"
- Golf + software passion. You're energized by this.
- PE jobs are demanding but not startup-demanding. You might have bandwidth for a side project.
- **Risk:** Non-compete/IP assignment clauses in your employment agreement. Check these before building anything.
- **Opportunity:** A side project keeps your builder instincts alive while the day job pays the bills and vests equity. Best of both worlds if you can manage the energy.

## What You Need To Do

### This Week (Urgent):
1. **Email HR/legal** about missing equity plan documents
2. **Find a PE tax attorney** — confirm profits interest safe harbor status and 83(b) implications
3. **Read your employment agreement** — check non-compete, IP assignment, moonlighting clauses

### This Month:
4. **Understand your performance vesting triggers** — what are the 2026 financial targets? You can't influence what you can't see.
5. **Map your new org** — 1:1s with every direct report. Understand the systems you now own (Ground Controls, FliteBrief, ForeFlight backend, ForeFlight Web).
6. **Identify quick wins** — what can you ship in 90 days that proves value in the new role?

### This Quarter:
7. **Establish visibility** — make sure CPO and TB operating partners know what you're delivering
8. **Start the golf side project exploration** — even if it's just a spec doc and some prototyping on weekends
9. **Review your financial position holistically** — don't count the equity as guaranteed income. Plan around salary + guaranteed comp.

### Ongoing:
10. **Monitor your energy** — you said you'll enjoy this more. Verify that at 3 months, 6 months. If it's draining you, reassess.
11. **Keep the CPO/boss relationship strong** — that's your insurance policy
12. **Stay technical** — your new role enables this. Use it. The builders survive PE transitions; the managers get consolidated.

## The Deeper Question

You said: *"I love golf, and I want to match my passion for golf and software product development."*

You also said you're excited to be more hands-on and away from product team friction.

**Pattern I'm noticing:** You're drawn to building things, not managing things. The PE role pays well but it's fundamentally a management job with a builder's equity structure. The golf idea is the builder in you looking for an outlet.

The smartest play might be: **Execute the PE role well enough to vest your equity, while quietly building the golf thing on the side.** Don't choose between them yet. Let the equity vest while you find out if the golf product has legs.

But don't let "I'll build the golf thing later" become avoidance of committing to either path. Set a decision point: *"By November 2026 (one year post-close), I'll know if I'm staying for the full ride or building an exit plan."*
