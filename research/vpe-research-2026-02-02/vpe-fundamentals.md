# VP of Engineering: Fundamentals for a 150-200 Person Org

*Research synthesis for a VPE at Jeppesen ForeFlight (~160 engineers across US/Denmark, mobile/web/server/QA teams)*

---

## 1. Core Responsibilities & Time Allocation

### The Three Hats (Will Larson, CTO at Carta)

Great VPEs must wear three opposing hats and toggle between them fluidly:

1. **Executive Team Member** — Finding ways to drive the business forward, sometimes making decisions that are "bad for engineering" (like reducing budget or moving to a business unit model)

2. **Engineering Manager** — Figuring out org structure, policies, and being an effective people leader

3. **Engineer** — Keeping the bar for technical excellence high despite external pressures

*The failure mode: leaning too heavily on one dimension.*

### Primary Responsibilities

**From multiple sources (LeadDev, Adeva, GitLab handbook):**

| Responsibility | What It Looks Like |
|----------------|-------------------|
| **Delivery & Execution** | Ensure teams deliver high-quality products on time and within budget. This is your credibility foundation. |
| **Strategy Translation** | Take the CTO/CEO vision and create actionable roadmaps. Own the "how" across multi-year goals. |
| **People Leadership** | Manage directors/senior managers. Run 1:1s, identify skill gaps, create growth paths. |
| **Cross-functional Partnership** | Work with Product, Design, Sales, Marketing to bring products to market. Advocate for engineering's voice. |
| **Budget & Resources** | Manage engineering budget, make buy/build decisions, optimize costs. |
| **Hiring & Retention** | Build high-performing teams, create hiring processes, retain top talent. |
| **Culture & Psychological Safety** | Foster inclusivity, create empowering environment where people can do their best work. |
| **Stakeholder Communication** | Report to CTO, CEO, board. Share successes, identify areas needing support, backed by metrics. |
| **Org Design** | Handle reorgs, M&A integrations, scaling the team structure. |

### Time Allocation Framework

**Chad Dickerson's advice to Lara Hogan (Etsy CTO → CEO):**

> "Every day when you get up in the morning, you should ask yourself if you're doing the right thing that day to deliver on your team's commitments."

**Suggested allocation for ~160 person org:**

- **30-40%** — Leadership & 1:1s (directs, skip-levels, peer relationships)
- **25-30%** — Strategy & Planning (roadmap, cross-functional alignment, technical direction)
- **15-20%** — Hiring & Org Health (recruiting, retention, culture)
- **10-15%** — Stakeholder Management (CEO, CPO, board, external)
- **5-10%** — Staying Technical (code reviews, architecture discussions, staying grounded)

**Key insight from Bruno Miranda (VPE, ~60-person team):**
> "You must still code. Don't give that up... you need to stay in touch with reality. Write tests, write code, deploy servers, fix bugs."

## 2. What Separates Great VPEs from Mediocre Ones

### The Six Traits (Harness/ThoughtSpot Chief Development Officer)

1. **Vulnerability** — Be open about your challenges and failures with leaders. "If you are not vulnerable, your team never will be." This builds trust and surfaces real problems.

2. **Transparency** — Explain the "why" behind decisions. Don't shield teams from challenges—include them. Share decision frameworks.

3. **Data-Driven Decisions** — Lead with metrics and KPIs. Data removes biases, improves focus, and lets you scale. "You can't improve what you can't measure."

4. **Decisiveness** — Better to decide at 60% confidence than wait. Listen to feedback, then make the call. You won't be liked by everyone—that's not your job.

5. **Empathy** — Treat people with respect. But empathy ≠ likeability. Challenge people, give actionable feedback, hold high standards.

6. **Letting People Go Quickly** — Recognize mismatches early. Don't rationalize poor performance. Be decisive—it hurts the whole team to lower your bar.

### What Great VPEs Do Differently

**From Will Larson's observations:**

- **They don't apply rules too universally** — "Anytime you apply a rule too universally, it turns into an anti-pattern." Context matters.

- **They get into the details when needed** — The best execs aren't just resource allocators. They understand the domain, can make technical decisions, know the levers that transform the business.

- **They mine for conflict** — When joining or assessing situations, actively seek out disagreements. "Find something controversial and test for conflict."

**From Marcel Weekes (VP Engineering, Figma):**

- Great managers have **different tools in their toolbelt** and know when to use each
- They manage both the **group dynamics** AND the **individuals** (junior vs senior, struggling vs thriving)
- They're **reflective** about what they could do differently

**From Lara Hogan/Chad Dickerson:**

- **They build credibility through delivery first** — "Your credibility in taking stands will always rest on delivery of product/infrastructure"
- **They can translate engineering to business** — "You are solely responsible for making that work"
- **They always have a story** — Give people higher purpose beyond roadmaps and priorities

## 3. Common Failure Modes & Blind Spots

### Failure Mode 1: Becoming a Bureaucrat

Will Larson: "Too many executives take the 'avoid micromanagement' advice and start to think of themselves only as resource allocators... As you get too far out of the details, you just become a bureaucrat."

**Signs:**
- Can't explain technical decisions your team is making
- Rely entirely on managers for context
- Can't engage meaningfully in architecture discussions

**Fix:** Get into the details when there's no clear path forward or when key people violently disagree. Stay technical enough to understand the levers.

### Failure Mode 2: Trying to Fix Everything at Once

From engineering leadership newsletter: "My second mistake was trying to fix everything at once. There were issues everywhere: architecture problems, technical debt, misalignment across departments."

**Fix:** Prioritize ruthlessly. Pick 2-4 focus areas per quarter.

### Failure Mode 3: Poor Communication

**Signs (from Adelina Chalmers):**
- Don't act as consistent voice between teams and CEO
- Always agree to deliver everything, then don't deliver
- Every delay is a surprise, always last minute
- "It's going well" with no specifics
- Never surface risks proactively

**Fix:** Over-communicate. Create shared artifacts (roadmaps, dashboards). Share risks early.

### Failure Mode 4: The New Manager Death Spiral (applicable to managers you oversee)

Marcel Weekes: "The team falls behind on a deadline. The manager jumps in to write code. Now they're stretched thin—partly managing, partly coding, not doing either well."

**Fix for your directors/managers:** Ensure they have mentors. Create training. Don't let them retreat to IC work.

### Failure Mode 5: Misaligned Relationship with Product

Chad Dickerson: "If you and the VP of Product are on the same page at all times, your life will be a lot easier. In multiple companies I've seen the VPE/Product relationship become strained—that is a road to pain, usually with engineering suffering the most."

**Why:** "It's generally easier to specify high-level product goals than to write complex software."

**Fix:** Over-communicate. Create agreed-upon processes (sprints, roadmap reviews) and artifacts. Always play offense.

### Failure Mode 6: Low Morale / High Turnover

**Signs:**
- Engineering team feels unsupported or undervalued
- High turnover rate
- Teams say they're "stuck in a rut" or not innovating
- Skip-levels reveal different picture than what managers report

**Fix:** Do skip-level 1:1s. Surface the truth. Invest in people development.

### Failure Mode 7: Context Blindness

Will Larson: "The #1 way new engineering leaders struggle is assuming context from their previous company applies as is."

**Fix:** "Mine for conflict" — have conversations to test your assumptions before implementing changes. Ask senior ICs, not just peers.

## 4. Key Relationships to Maintain

### With the CEO

**Chad Dickerson's advice:**

1. **Ask regularly what you can do to make their job easier** — Solve problems in your domain without unnecessary escalation

2. **Be the bridge** — "You're in a senior functional position reporting to someone who has never done your job before. Your job is being a bridge between technology and business."

3. **Translate engineering** — Replace engineering shorthand with language executives understand. "If it's not working, it's on you."

4. **Empathize with CEO psychology** — Running a tech business as a non-engineer is HARD. Read about CEO psychology.

5. **Push back when necessary** — Take stands, but only after you've built credibility through delivery

### With the CPO / VP of Product

**From multiple sources:**

- **Partner "absurdly closely"** — If you're aligned at all times, everything is easier
- **Create shared artifacts** — Roadmaps, sprint cadences, estimates
- **Ensure tradeoffs are understood** — Product specifies goals; you surface technical constraints
- **Always play offense** — If you hear "what are all these engineers doing?" you have work to do

**Clear division of responsibilities:**
- **VPE:** Technical architecture, infrastructure, development processes, team management, delivery execution
- **VP Product:** Customer needs, product roadmaps, feature prioritization, market research, business alignment

### With Other VPs / Executives

Chad Dickerson: "Ask your executive peers regularly what you can do to make their jobs easier."

Will Larson on executive translation: "Many high-agency managers try to prevent executives from doing silly things. It's almost always more effective to **translate their energy for a silly thing into energy for a useful thing.**"

**Examples:**
- CEO obsessed with LLMs? Translate into useful AI approach rather than fighting it
- Want to expand without hiring? Use a hackathon to validate with users first
- Want a giant rewrite? Translate into a narrow test rewrite of one feature

### With Direct Reports (Directors, Senior Managers)

- **Regular 1:1s** — Weekly or bi-weekly
- **Skip-level 1:1s** — Monthly with their reports (surface truth)
- **Growth paths** — Create clear progression for EMs and ICs
- **Mentor them** — Share your hard-won lessons so they don't repeat mistakes
- **Hold them accountable** — Don't lower the bar

### With the Board

Chad Dickerson: "Develop the right relationship with members of your company's board."

- Present engineering state with **meaningful metrics**
- Share successes AND areas needing support
- Understand what they care about (usually: velocity, cost efficiency, risk)

## 5. Metrics & Outcomes to Own

### Framework: Measure for Engineers AND the CEO

Will Larson's key insight: Both audiences need different metrics. Engineers want technical health; CEOs want business impact and cost efficiency.

### Core Metric Categories

**1. Delivery & Execution**
- Roadmap delivery rate (committed vs delivered)
- Time-to-market for key initiatives
- Sprint velocity trends (for capacity planning, not performance)
- Incidents & reliability (uptime, MTTR, incident frequency)

**2. Team Health & Productivity**
- DORA metrics (deployment frequency, lead time, change failure rate, MTTR)
- Developer experience surveys
- Cycle time (idea → production)
- Technical debt ratio (% of work on maintenance vs new features)

**3. People & Organization**
- Retention rate (overall, key performers)
- Hiring velocity (time-to-fill, offer acceptance rate)
- Employee engagement scores
- Span of control ratios
- Promotion/growth rate

**4. Quality**
- Bug escape rate (production bugs per release)
- Test coverage trends
- Customer-facing incidents
- Security vulnerabilities

**5. Business Alignment**
- Engineering cost as % of revenue
- Revenue/impact per engineer
- Time allocation (new product vs maintenance vs tech debt)

### What NOT to Measure (or be cautious with)

Will Larson: "There are no measures that I find super helpful [for pure velocity]. There are teams where one individual may be pulling a ton of weight. Then there are teams that have one individual getting in the way."

**Avoid:**
- Lines of code
- Commits per person
- "Story points" as performance measure
- Comparing individuals by velocity

### Quarterly Focus

From the Harness article: "Choose a few metrics to focus on improving every quarter. Be vigilant in working to achieve those goals, as it can help you communicate specific improvements made under your leadership."

## 6. Special Considerations for Your Context

### Boeing Subsidiary (Jeppesen ForeFlight)

- **Regulatory environment** — Aviation software has safety implications. Quality and reliability metrics are especially critical.
- **Mature processes** — Likely more process-heavy than startups. Balance process with agility.
- **Legacy systems** — May have significant tech debt. Track modernization progress.

### Distributed Team (US + Denmark)

- **Time zone overlap** — Create clear async communication practices
- **Cultural differences** — Invest in understanding Danish work culture
- **Unified culture** — Create shared values that transcend geography
- **Meeting cadence** — Structure key syncs to work for both time zones

### Transitioning to Backend Focus

- **Hand off gracefully** — Don't just drop mobile/web/QA. Ensure strong leadership in place.
- **Maintain relationships** — Stay connected to teams you're transitioning away from
- **Build backend context** — If new to backend, do "conflict mining" to understand the landscape
- **Avoid assumptions** — What worked in mobile may not apply to backend
