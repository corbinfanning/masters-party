*Research date: February 2026*

---

## 1. The Combined Entity: Jeppesen ForeFlight

In April 2025, Boeing sold its Digital Aviation Solutions assets—**Jeppesen, ForeFlight, AerData, and OzRunways**—to **Thoma Bravo** for **$10.55 billion** all-cash. The deal closed November 2025. The sale valued the combined entity at **~16x 2025 EBITDA** (per Reuters), implying roughly **$650-660M in EBITDA**. A bidding war in March 2025 saw PE firms valuing Jeppesen alone at $8-9B.

The new entity, **Jeppesen ForeFlight**, is led by CEO Brad Surak (former Boeing Digital Aviation head) and operates as a standalone company. Thoma Bravo manages $181B+ in AUM focused on software/tech investments.

**Implied revenue estimate:** At typical software margins (60-70% EBITDA margins for data/subscription businesses), the combined entity likely generates **$900M–$1.1B+ in annual revenue**. Jeppesen alone had ~3,200 employees; the combined unit had ~3,900 before the sale.

## 2. Competitive Landscape

### 2A. EFB (Electronic Flight Bag) Market

**Market size:** ~$3B in 2025, growing at **7-9% CAGR** through 2030-2032 (various market research estimates range from $3.0B to $3.97B in 2025 depending on scope definition).

#### Major Players

| Competitor | Segment | Platform | Pricing (Annual, US) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **ForeFlight** | GA, Business, Military | iOS/iPadOS only | Starter $125, Essential $250, Premium $370 (post-2025 hike: ~$150/$300/$445) | **Market leader in GA/BizAv EFB.** "Most widely used aviation app for iPhone and iPad" |
| **Garmin Pilot** | GA, some BizAv | iOS + Android | Navigator ~$109, Pilot ~$209 | **#2 in GA.** Deep Garmin avionics integration. Cross-platform advantage. |
| **SkyDemon** | VFR (mainly Europe) | iOS, Android, PC | ~€110-130/yr | Dominant in European VFR. Intuitive, great ADS-B/FLARM integration. Not strong in IFR. |
| **Jeppesen FliteDeck Pro** | Airlines, BizAv | iOS, Windows | Enterprise pricing | Jeppesen's own EFB for commercial/enterprise. Now part of same entity as ForeFlight. |
| **FltPlan Go** | GA | iOS, Android | **Free** | Garmin acquired FltPlan.com; now integrated into Garmin Pilot ecosystem. |
| **iFly GPS** | GA (budget) | Android, iOS | ~$75/yr | Niche. Popular with budget-conscious Android users. |
| **WingX** | GA | iOS | ~$75/yr basic | Smaller player, declining relevance. |
| **OzRunways** | GA (Australia) | iOS | ~AUD 130/yr | Now owned by Jeppesen ForeFlight (part of Thoma Bravo deal). |

#### ForeFlight's Dominance

ForeFlight **dominates the GA/personal aviation EFB market** in the US. Community consensus is clear: "ForeFlight dominates the market, and it's not even close." Key advantages:

- **First-mover:** Available since iPad launch (2010), 15 years of compounding features
- **iOS-native design:** Deeply integrated with Apple's UX conventions; "just works"
- **Network effects:** CFIs teach with ForeFlight → students adopt it → it becomes the default
- **Jeppesen data integration:** Only EFB with native Jeppesen charts (since 2017 partnership, 2019 acquisition)
- **Professional features:** Runway analysis, dispatch, W&B for hundreds of aircraft types
- **Military adoption:** DoD-specific Military Flight Bag (MFB) product with NGA data, DAFIF, 557th Weather Wing integration

**Weakness:** iOS-only. Android users default to Garmin Pilot. No web-based in-flight capability.

### 2B. Flight Planning & Operations (Airline/Enterprise)

| Competitor | Parent | Key Products | Segment |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Jeppesen** | Jeppesen ForeFlight / Thoma Bravo | Flight planning, crew scheduling, fuel management, ops control | Commercial airlines, BizAv, Military |
| **NAVBLUE** | Airbus | N-Flight Planning, N-Ops (crew/dispatch), LIDO charts | Airlines (especially Airbus operators) |
| **Lufthansa Systems (LIDO)** | Lufthansa Group | LIDO charts, mPilot EFB, flight planning | Airlines |
| **Honeywell Forge** | Honeywell | Flight planning, weather, connected aircraft | Airlines, BizAv |
| **SITA** | Industry consortium | Flight planning, messaging | Airlines |
| **Sabre/Amadeus** | Independent | Operations solutions | Airlines (broader travel tech) |
| **Collins Aerospace** | RTX | Flight planning, avionics data | Airlines, Defense |

**NAVBLUE** is Jeppesen's most direct competitor in airline ops—it's Airbus's in-house subsidiary (formed from Navtech acquisition + Airbus LUCEM + ProSky). NAVBLUE offers flight planning, performance engineering, digital cockpit solutions, and crew management. It naturally captures Airbus-operated airlines but lacks Jeppesen's cross-platform/OEM neutrality.

**Lufthansa Systems LIDO** is a credible alternative for charts and flight planning. Airlines like Air Canada, Singapore Airlines, Easyjet, DHL, Emirates, and Air France have used LIDO charts. However, LIDO is more airline-focused and lacks the GA/BizAv penetration of Jeppesen.

### 2C. Aeronautical Data

| Provider | Coverage | Use Cases | Certification Level |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Jeppesen NavData** | Global (190 countries) | FMS databases, charts, EFB, avionics | Highest; FAA/EASA certified for operational use |
| **NAVBLUE/LIDO** | Global (airline-focused) | LIDO charts, navdata for Airbus FMS | Certified but narrower ecosystem |
| **Government sources (FAA, etc.)** | Country-specific | Free AIP charts, DAFIF (military) | Official but not integrated |
| **Navigraph** | Global | Flight simulation only | **NOT certified for real-world use** |

## 3. ForeFlight Market Share & Pricing

### Market Position

ForeFlight does not publish subscriber numbers, but evidence strongly suggests it is the **dominant GA EFB in the United States:**

- Described as "most widely used aviation app for iPhone and iPad" by iPad Pilot News (a tracking authority on EFBs for 15 years)
- Community consensus across Reddit r/flying, aviation forums: ForeFlight holds **estimated 60-70%+ share** of paid GA EFB subscriptions in the US
- Most flight schools standardize on ForeFlight
- Garmin Pilot is the clear **#2** but with meaningfully less adoption
- SkyDemon leads in European VFR but has minimal US presence

### Pricing & Revenue Model

**Consumer (GA) pricing (post-March 2025 increase):**
| Plan | Old Price | New Price (post-20% hike) | Key Features |
|---|---|---|---|
| Starter (was Basic Plus) | $99.99/yr | $125/yr | Charts, weather, flight planning, logbook |
| Essential (was Pro Plus) | $199.99/yr | $250/yr | + Geo-referenced plates, synthetic vision, profile view |
| Premium (was Performance Plus) | $299.99/yr | $370/yr | + Aircraft performance profiles, runway analysis, Airport 3D |

**Add-ons:** Jeppesen IFR charts (CONUS ~$100+/yr), Jeppesen VFR charts (Europe), various regional chart packages. ForeFlight Dispatch (enterprise pricing). Runway Analysis (enterprise add-on for jets).

**Military Flight Bag (MFB):** Separate pricing tiers (MFB Starter, MFB Essential, MFB Performance, MFB One). Sold both to individual military pilots and via squadron/unit contracts.

**Enterprise/Airline:** Jeppesen's airline products (NavData, FliteDeck, crew scheduling, fuel management) are sold via multi-year enterprise contracts. Pricing is not public but is typically **per-aircraft or per-pilot** with significant annual recurring revenue.

**Key observation:** ForeFlight raised prices **20% across the board** in March 2025—notably, **right before the Thoma Bravo acquisition closed**. This is a classic PE playbook move. Pricing had been unchanged for 5+ years, demonstrating latent pricing power.

## 4. Jeppesen's Data Moat

### Why the Moat is Enormous

Jeppesen's aeronautical data business is one of the most defensible moats in aviation software. Here's why:

#### 4A. Regulatory/Certification Barriers
- **FAA Part 97 / EASA compliance:** Aeronautical data used for flight operations must meet stringent accuracy and timeliness standards. Jeppesen is certified as a Qualified Internet Communications Provider (QICP) by the FAA since 2003.
- **DO-200A/DO-200B compliance:** The FAA requires that navigation databases used in certified avionics (FMS, GPS navigators) come from an approved data supplier. Jeppesen NavData is the de facto standard.
- **Every FMS on every commercial aircraft** needs a navigation database updated on a 28-day AIRAC (Aeronautical Information Regulation and Control) cycle. Jeppesen has been doing this since 1973—over 50 years.

#### 4B. Scale and Network Effects
- Jeppesen processes **~47,000 pieces of source information from 190 countries** per update cycle
- Used by "almost every major avionics manufacturer in the world" (Garmin, Honeywell, Collins Aerospace, Thales, etc.)
- The NavData format (ARINC 424) is an industry standard that Jeppesen helped create and define
- **Deep OEM relationships:** Garmin, Honeywell, and Collins pre-load Jeppesen NavData into their avionics; switching would require re-certification of every avionics platform

#### 4C. Institutional Knowledge
- 90+ year heritage of charting (founded 1934)
- ~3,200 employees including hundreds of geospatial experts, cartographers, and aeronautical data analysts
- Proprietary processes for quality assurance that are "over four times more accurate than leading competitors" (Jeppesen's claim for military NavData)
- Decades of accumulated error-correction and validation data

#### 4D. Switching Costs
- **Airlines:** Switching chart/data providers requires pilot retraining (Jeppesen and LIDO charts use different conventions), new EFB certifications, and contractual transitions. Airlines tend to sign multi-year contracts.
- **Avionics OEMs:** Garmin, Honeywell, Collins, etc. have certified their products specifically with Jeppesen NavData. Switching would require re-certification—an expensive, multi-year process.
- **Pilot training ecosystem:** Flight schools, training programs, and the FAA itself reference Jeppesen chart formats. The entire pilot training pipeline uses Jeppesen conventions.

#### 4E. Could It Be Replicated?

**Theoretically yes, practically near-impossible in a reasonable timeframe:**

- **Government data is free but raw:** FAA provides free AIP charts, but they're country-specific, not standardized globally, and not suitable for direct FMS integration without extensive processing
- **NAVBLUE/LIDO** is the closest competitor but is captive to Airbus and lacks the general aviation and avionics OEM penetration
- **Navigraph** licenses Jeppesen data for flight simulation—they're a **customer**, not a competitor. Their product explicitly states "NOT for real-world use"
- Building the **global team** to survey, validate, and certify data from 190 countries would take **10+ years and hundreds of millions of dollars**
- Achieving OEM integration with all major avionics manufacturers would require individually certifying with each platform—another multi-year process per OEM

**Verdict: Jeppesen's data moat is one of the widest in aviation. It's closer to a natural monopoly than a typical software market.** The combination with ForeFlight's consumer/military EFB further solidifies this by controlling both the data layer and the presentation layer.

## 6. Pricing Power Analysis

### Evidence of Strong Pricing Power

1. **20% price hike in March 2025** with minimal churn risk—ForeFlight prices had been flat for 5+ years, indicating significant latent pricing power
2. **Near-monopoly in GA EFB:** When pilots say "ForeFlight dominates the market, and it's not even close," that's pricing power
3. **Jeppesen NavData is embedded in avionics:** Airlines and avionics OEMs can't easily switch, creating annuity-like revenue with inflation-plus pricing ability
4. **28-day update cycle:** The AIRAC cycle creates **forced recurring revenue**—you can't fly with outdated navigation data
5. **Safety-critical product:** Pilots and airlines won't switch data providers to save money when safety is at stake
6. **Vertical integration:** Owning both data (Jeppesen) and presentation (ForeFlight) means competitors can't unbundle the offering
7. **PE playbook:** Thoma Bravo is known for acquiring dominant software companies and systematically raising prices. Expect continued price increases of 5-15% annually.

### Risks to Pricing Power

- **Government data going free/open:** If FAA/ICAO created a free, global, FMS-compatible navigation database, it could disrupt Jeppesen's data revenue. This is unlikely—decades of discussion with no progress.
- **Garmin competing harder:** Garmin has deep pockets, owns its own avionics, and could invest heavily in Garmin Pilot if it wanted to challenge ForeFlight. Garmin could potentially create its own navigation database ecosystem.
- **NAVBLUE/Airbus expansion:** If Airbus aggressively expands NAVBLUE beyond its captive airline base, it could compete more directly. However, Airbus appears content with NAVBLUE as a complement to aircraft sales rather than a standalone profit center.
- **Thoma Bravo over-extraction:** If PE pushes prices too aggressively, it could accelerate competitor investment or open-source alternatives. The flight sim community is already wary of post-acquisition price hikes flowing through to Navigraph.
- **Android platform gap:** ForeFlight's iOS-only stance leaves a permanent opening for Garmin Pilot and others on Android.

### Net Assessment

**Pricing power: Very Strong (8/10)**

The Jeppesen ForeFlight combination has one of the strongest pricing positions in aviation software. Jeppesen's data is near-irreplaceable, ForeFlight is the de facto standard for pilot EFBs, switching costs are enormous, and the safety-critical nature of the product makes customers highly price-inelastic. The 16x EBITDA acquisition multiple reflects this—Thoma Bravo is paying for a **durable, inflation-protected revenue stream** with clear paths to price expansion and TAM growth.

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Jeppesen's data moat is arguably one of the widest in all of aviation software.** 90 years of heritage, regulatory certification requirements, OEM lock-in, and global scale make it nearly impossible to replicate.

2. **ForeFlight dominates GA/personal aviation EFB** with estimated 60-70%+ US market share. Network effects from flight schools and CFIs create self-reinforcing adoption.

3. **The $10.55B valuation at ~16x EBITDA** reflects the quality of the combined franchise—data moat + consumer dominance + military expansion + airline enterprise.

4. **Growth vectors are multiple and clear:** Military IL5, international expansion, business aviation upsell, airline digital transformation, and AI-powered operations.

5. **Thoma Bravo will raise prices.** They already started with the 20% hike. Expect continued 5-15% annual increases with limited churn, given the captive customer base and lack of viable alternatives.

6. **Main competitive risk is Garmin** in GA EFB and **NAVBLUE** in airline operations, but neither threatens the core Jeppesen data monopoly.
