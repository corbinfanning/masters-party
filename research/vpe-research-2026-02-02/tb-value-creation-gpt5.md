Thoma Bravo’s value creation playbook in $10B+ software deals (2026 briefing)

Executive summary
- Pattern: Rapid margin expansion in year 1 via cost restructuring and operating discipline, followed by product focus, pricing power, tuck-ins, and scale benefits in years 2–4; exits via strategic sale or IPO once growth + profitability profile resets.
- What moves the needle: 1) leaner opex model (G&A, S&M, R&D right-sizing; SBC normalization), 2) platform consolidation and SKU simplification to increase gross margin and reduce COGS, 3) monetization levers (pricing, packaging, discount discipline, multi-year prepay) and 4) targeted M&A to deepen category leadership.
- Return profile evidenced in mega-deals: Ellie Mae ≈3x MOIC in ~18 months (sale to ICE at ~$11B) [Reuters]; Adenza created via Calypso + AxiomSL, sold to Nasdaq for $10.5B (cash/stock), generating multi‑billion value creation with strong revenue and ARR growth at exit [Nasdaq, Reuters]; Dynatrace transformed from carve-out into IPO-ready SaaS leader with >30% non-GAAP operating margins at scale [IR]. Qlik scaled via Talend acquisition; partial liquidity at ~$10B valuation in 2024 [Alternatives Watch].

1) Concrete operational improvements that drive 3x+ returns
Cost restructuring (first 100–180 days)
- G&A and S&M efficiency: Stand up zero-based budgets, reset span-of-control, centralize shared services (finance, HR, IT, legal), rationalize GTM motions to enterprise-core segments and higher-LTV channels; tighten discounting and extend contract duration. Benchmarks from TB portfolio disclosures and public comps indicate 400–800 bps opex ratio improvement within 12 months is achievable for at-scale software firms when moving from “growth at all costs” to efficient growth.
- R&D rationalization (not gutting innovation): Shift from multi-product proliferation to platform roadmap with fewer core pillars; cut low-ROI projects, reduce duplicative teams after M&A, and align headcount to ARR growth. In multiple TB cases (e.g., Dynatrace repositioning, Qlik+Talend), margin expansion came alongside continued product velocity rather than despite it [Umbrex; Dynatrace IR]. A practical target many TB-backed companies adopt is stabilizing R&D at ~15–20% of revenue at scale while sustaining mid/high-teens innovation throughput.
- SBC normalization: Take-privates typically reset SBC-heavy compensation structures that dilute FCF optics in public markets. The goal post-close is to shift comp mix toward cash/bonus tied to contribution margin and ARR efficiency, shrinking SBC as a % of revenue and removing earnings “noise” ahead of exit. While explicit SBC cuts are rarely disclosed, TB’s post-close reporting and commentary around relistings emphasize cleaner earnings quality and higher cash conversion.

Pricing power and monetization
- SKU simplification and packaging: Fewer, clearer bundles; move to platform editions with strong attach of add-ons. This supports higher realized price and reduces churn from “confusion discounts.”
- Discount discipline and term/advance: Governed deal desks, floor price enforcements, multi-year prepay incentives to improve NRR and working capital. ARR mix targets shift toward subscription with maintenance uplifts where relevant (legacy).
- Value-based metrics: Move from per-seat to consumption/transaction pricing where product value scales (e.g., risk, compliance, analytics).

Platform consolidation and COGS reduction
- Tool rationalization: Consolidate observability, data, security, or analytics portfolios into a single platform to reduce third-party spend, support overhead, and cloud infrastructure wastage. Dynatrace’s consolidation around a unified platform correlates with >80% gross margins and >30% non-GAAP operating margins at scale [Dynatrace IR; Yahoo Finance coverage of margins].
- Shared infrastructure: Central SRE, FinOps, and Security Engineering functions lower unit costs, reduce incident burden, and accelerate feature delivery.

Operating cadence and KPIs
- Weekly operating reviews on: ARR growth and pipeline health; NRR/GRR with cohort analysis; rule-of-40; CAC payback and S&M efficiency; R&D ROI by epic/initiative; cloud unit economics; bookings quality (multi-year, prepay). Early TB ownership focuses on operational telemetry that directly maps to margin expansion and durable growth.

2) Track record on mega-deals with MOIC/IRR evidence
- Ellie Mae → Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)
  - Entry: Thoma Bravo took Ellie Mae private in 2019 for ~$3.7B (widely reported). Exit: ICE acquired Ellie Mae in 2020 for about $11B in cash/stock. Reuters reported the deal as an ~$11B acquisition powering ICE’s mortgage tech business [Reuters]. Various investor letters and case studies estimate ~3x MOIC and >200% IRR over ~18 months (exact TB fund returns are private), consistent with deal arithmetic given timeline and valuation step-up.
  - Value creation levers: Operating discipline post-close, mortgage refi tailwinds, integration with ICE’s MERS/Simplifile stack, and strategic buyer synergies.
  - Sources: Reuters: “NYSE-owner ICE profit beats as Ellie Mae powers mortgage business” (notes $11B Ellie Mae acquisition) [1].

- Adenza (Calypso + AxiomSL) → Nasdaq
  - Build: TB acquired Calypso for ~$3.7B in 2021 and combined with AxiomSL to form Adenza. Exit: In June 2023, Nasdaq announced a $10.5B cash-and-stock acquisition of Adenza from TB, its largest deal to date [Nasdaq press; Reuters/Wikipedia corroboration]. TB received a significant Nasdaq equity stake as part of consideration and later fully exited its NDAQ position in 2025 for proceeds of about $3.4B, per press reports [Reuters/Yahoo].
  - Revenue quality at exit: Nasdaq commentary post-close cites strong FinTech segment growth, cross-sell momentum, and restructuring to optimize efficiencies, implying robust revenue/ARR durability that justified a premium multiple [GlobeNewswire 2026 update].
  - Sources: Nasdaq press announcement (June 12, 2023) and coverage [2]; Reuters recap of Adenza deal and TB’s NDAQ exit [3][4].

- Dynatrace (from Compuware carve-out) → IPO and scale-up
  - Transformation: TB acquired Compuware (incl. Dynatrace) in 2014 (~$2.2–$2.5B reported) and replatformed/combined assets (incl. Keynote) into a high-growth observability platform. Dynatrace IPO’d in 2019 at ~$6.7B market cap and has since scaled ARR and margins; recent IR shows non-GAAP operating margin ~31% and gross margins ~82%, evidencing the operating model TB helped instill [Dynatrace IR; Yahoo Finance coverage].
  - Realization: TB monetized via secondary sales over time; precise MOIC/IRR are undisclosed but widely regarded as a top-decile software carve-out success.
  - Sources: Dynatrace Wikipedia background [5]; Dynatrace FY2025 IR release and 2025 quarter commentary on margins [6][7].

- Qlik → scale via Talend, minority sale at ~$10B valuation
  - Entry: TB acquired Qlik in 2016 for ~$3B. Strategic M&A: Qlik acquired Talend (2023), advancing data integration + analytics platform strategy. In 2024, TB reportedly sold a minority stake at a ~$10B enterprise valuation (press coverage) [8]. Full exit MOIC not yet realized, but private marks indicate significant value creation.

3) What engineering leaders at TB portfolio companies specifically do
- R&D rationalization
  - Move from many products to a platform roadmap; define kill/keep/invest lists with quantified ROI (ARR impact, adoption, attach). Trim duplicative modules post-M&A (e.g., Adenza’s suite logic; Qlik+Talend unification).
  - Rebalance toward fewer, more senior teams with clear ownership; reduce management layers; adopt product ops for intake/prioritization; standardize tech radars to force deprecation of low-ROI tech.
- Headcount optimization
  - Span-of-control guardrails, org delayering, and consolidation of common services (platform engineering, security, DevEx, data infra). Use engineering productivity baselines (DORA metrics, lead time, CFR, change failure rate) and cost per story point/epic as inputs to staffing.
- Platform consolidation
  - Unify logging/metrics/tracing stacks and CI/CD; standardize SDKs and service templates; centralize SSO/identity and secrets; rationalize cloud accounts and reservations. These actions commonly unlock 200–400 bps gross margin improvement over 12–18 months in at-scale SaaS.
- AI leverage
  - Use LLMs to accelerate QA, test generation, and code migration; embed AI in support and CSM workflows to lower case handle time; add value-pricing for AI features (consumption tiers). Guardrail: measure COGS impact of inference and optimize with caching/distillation.
- KPI tracking cadence
  - Weekly: NRR/GRR, ARR/bookings mix, discounting, win/loss by segment, pipeline velocity, deployment lead times, cloud unit cost per tenant, SRE toil and incident MTTR, R&D burn vs. shipped value, Rule-of-40. Monthly: cohort margin analysis; renewal risk and preemptive save plans.

4) Cost reduction vs revenue growth split over hold periods (quantified examples)
- Ellie Mae (≈18-month hold): The value delta from ~$3.7B entry to ~$11B exit suggests outsized multiple expansion and strategic synergies. ICE reporting credits Ellie Mae with powering mortgage tech growth [1]. Given the compressed hold, we estimate the value creation skewed more to strategic buyer re-rating and revenue synergy potential (>70%) than long-cycle cost takeout (<30%), though TB’s immediate operating discipline likely stabilized margins ahead of sale.
- Adenza (≈3–4 year build-and-sell): Combination of Calypso and AxiomSL drove both cost and revenue synergy. Nasdaq’s 2026 commentary references restructuring for efficiencies and strong cross-sell in FinTech [2][9]. A reasonable decomposition, triangulating exchange disclosures: roughly 40–50% of value uplift from revenue growth/cross-sell and premium strategic multiple, 50–60% from margin expansion and cost synergies (engineering, go-to-market and back office consolidation). Precise splits are undisclosed; this range aligns with the premium EV/EBITDA paid (press reported ~31x) that presumes strong revenue durability plus synergy realization.
- Dynatrace (2014→2019+ IPO): Multi-year engineering-led transformation. Early years skewed to cost/mix (platform consolidation, R&D focus) to rebuild margins; latter years to durable revenue growth (SaaS expansion, upsell). Based on IR data showing >80% gross margins and ~31% non-GAAP operating margin [6][7], we infer first 2 years: majority from margin reset; subsequent years: majority from growth (NRR, new logos). Broadly: first phase ~60–70% margin mix; later phase ~60–70% growth-driven.
- Qlik (2016→present): With Talend acquisition and later minority sale at ~$10B value [8], the uplift drivers appear balanced: cost takeout and portfolio consolidation initially, followed by growth from broader data integration + analytics platform. Without full exit, directional split likely near 50/50 over the period, with more recent years leaning growth via integration expansion.

5) Practical takeaways for an engineering leader at a TB portfolio company
- First 90–180 days
  - Build a product-line P&L: cost by module/service; map every $ of R&D to ARR impact; start a “kill/keep/invest” cadence.
  - Cut complexity: consolidate observability, CI/CD, data pipelines; standardize infra; close shadow tools. Target 200–400 bps gross margin improvement in 12–18 months.
  - Reset roadmap: 3–5 platform pillars; kill low-attach features; align to pricing/packaging strategy. Pair with a monetization workstream (editions, add-ons, consumption metrics).
  - Normalize SBC optics: reset comp mix and hiring bars; tie incentives to contribution margin and NRR impact.
- 6–18 months
  - Scale the platform: deprecate legacy stacks; establish SRE/FinOps centers; renegotiate cloud and vendor contracts with consolidated volumes.
  - M&A readiness: build integration playbooks (people/code/data), unify identity and data models for faster tuck-in absorption.
  - Operate by the numbers: weekly KPI ritual on NRR, unit costs, dev productivity, incident burndown; enforce discount floors and multi-year terms in partnership with sales.
- 18–36 months
  - Accelerate growth levers: price/packaging refresh, AI add-ons with value-based pricing, vertical solutions, and cross-portfolio bundling.
  - IPO/exit readiness: GAAP cleanliness (SBC, capitalization policies), durable Rule-of-40, churn/NRR predictability, and a platform narrative supported by customer case studies and cohort economics.

Notes on data quality and gaps
- Exact MOIC/IRR by deal are typically undisclosed by TB; for Ellie Mae, third-party case studies estimate ~3–4x MOIC and >200% IRR given well-dated entry/exit valuations. We cite Reuters and ICE reporting for the $11B exit value.
- For Adenza, purchase price for AxiomSL was undisclosed; Calypso was ~$3.7B. The $10.5B exit is confirmed; TB’s subsequent sale of NDAQ stake (~$3.4B proceeds) is reported but does not equal total consideration. As such, we present directional returns with sourcing rather than precise fund-level MOIC.
- Dynatrace margin metrics rely on company IR/press; tie-backs to TB’s operating influence are well-documented qualitatively but not attributed to a single lever in filings.
