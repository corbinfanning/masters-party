# Thoma Bravo & PE Expectations for Engineering Leaders

*Research compiled 2026-02-02*

## 1. Rule of 40 (and Rule of 60)

**The Standard: Rule of 40**
- **Formula:** Revenue Growth Rate + Profit Margin ≥ 40%
- A SaaS health metric popularized by VCs (Brad Feld, 2015), now the primary KPI for PE-owned software companies
- Profit margin typically measured via EBITDA or Free Cash Flow

**Rule of 60 (Thoma Bravo's Aggressive Target)**
- Some PE firms, including Thoma Bravo on their higher-performing deals, push for **Rule of 60** - the same formula but targeting 60%
- This is relevant for companies that can maintain moderate growth (15-25%) while achieving 35-45% EBITDA margins
- Essentially: "If growth is slowing, margins must compensate aggressively"

**What This Means for Engineering:**
- At a 15% growth company, you need **25-45% EBITDA margins** to hit Rule of 40-60
- Engineering is typically 25-40% of a software company's cost structure
- **Translation:** Engineering headcount/spend will be scrutinized heavily as the largest lever to improve margins

## 2. How PE Measures Engineering Efficiency

**Key Metrics They Track:**
1. **Revenue per Engineer** - Target varies by maturity ($300K-$500K+/engineer for mature products)
2. **R&D as % of Revenue** - Mature SaaS target: 15-20% (down from 25-35% growth-stage)
3. **Cost per Story Point/Feature** - Controversial but used by some PE ops teams
4. **Engineering headcount vs. ARR growth** - Must show diminishing headcount needs as ARR grows
5. **Time to Production** - How fast does code ship?
6. **Technical Debt Cost** - Can work be offloaded or simplified?

**The Bain Framework (from their research):**
- PE-backed companies must focus on "Engineering Productivity" as growth slows
- Key challenges: balancing new feature delivery with maintenance while managing technical debt
- Success requires "clarity on priorities and visibility into how sprawling engineering groups are spending time"

## 3. Thoma Bravo's Typical Operational Playbook

Based on their 440+ software deals and pattern from acquisitions like Jeppesen/ForeFlight (40-50% layoffs in Jan 2026), Proofpoint, Anaplan, etc.:

**Phase 1 (0-90 days): Assessment**
- Detailed engineering cost audit
- Role-by-role productivity assessment
- Identify "overlap" across teams/products
- Technical debt/architecture review

**Phase 2 (90-180 days): Restructuring**
- **Headcount reduction:** Typically 15-30%, sometimes higher (Jeppesen saw 40-50%)
- **Management layer removal:** Flatten org, increase spans of control
- **"Buy vs. Build" review:** Kill internal tools, use vendors
- **Product portfolio rationalization:** Kill low-margin products/features

**Phase 3 (180+ days): Optimization**
- **Geo-diversification** (see #6)
- Standardize engineering processes across portfolio companies
- Implement metrics/reporting culture
- Prepare for exit (typically 3-5 year horizon)

**Thoma Bravo's Specific Reputation:**
- Known for aggressive but systematic cost optimization
- Uses "buy and build" strategy - acquisitions to add capability, not headcount
- Strong operational playbook refined over 440+ software deals
- Currently manages $160B+ AUM with a lean 212-person team (efficiency by example)

## 4. What a $3M Equity Grant Means for a VPE

**The Math:**
A $3M equity grant in a PE context typically means:
- **Current valuation share:** You're buying into the company at today's price
- **Target exit:** 2.5-3x return over 4-5 years = your $3M becomes $7.5-9M
- **But:** This assumes the fund hits its target return and your shares aren't diluted

**What They're Buying From You:**

1. **Execution on the margin expansion playbook** - They expect you to deliver the headcount reductions and efficiency gains
2. **Political cover** - An insider VPE making cuts has different optics than PE overlords
3. **Retention through transition** - You're handcuffed through the hard work and can't leave easily
4. **Technical judgment** - Which people/projects are dispensable without breaking the product?

**Red Flags to Watch:**
- **Vesting cliff:** Is it backloaded? (Common in PE deals to ensure you stay for the hard part)
- **Exit scenarios:** What happens on partial vs. full sale? Secondary buyouts?
- **Participation preferences:** Do PE investors get paid first, diluting your stake?
- **Performance conditions:** Is the equity contingent on hitting targets?

**Questions to Ask:**
- What's the current enterprise value and my % ownership?
- What's the fund's target IRR and typical hold period?
- What's my shares' waterfall position in various exit scenarios?
- Are there ratchets or anti-dilution provisions I should know about?

## 5. Common Tensions Between PE Objectives and Engineering Culture

| PE Priority | Engineering Culture Clash |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| **Short-term margin improvement** | Long-term technical investment (pay down debt, platform rewrites) |
| **Headcount reduction** | Team knowledge loss, morale collapse, survivor's guilt |
| **Metrics-driven management** | "What gets measured gets gamed" - story points, velocity gaming |
| **Cost center framing** | Engineers want to be seen as value creators, not expenses |
| **Speed of decisions** | Engineers want deliberation, proof, consensus |
| **Flatten management** | Senior ICs lose career paths; managers have unsustainable spans |
| **Outsourcing/offshoring** | Quality concerns, communication overhead, "us vs. them" |
| **Product rationalization** | Engineers emotionally invested in products being killed |

**How to Navigate:**
- **Frame everything in business terms** - "Technical debt slows feature velocity by X%"
- **Build relationships with operating partners** - They often have more nuance than raw PE partners
- **Get ahead of cuts** - Propose restructuring before it's imposed
- **Protect your key people** - Know who you absolutely cannot lose
- **Document everything** - Your decisions will be reviewed

## 6. Geo-Diversification Strategy (Denmark vs. US)

**The PE Logic:**
- US engineer: $200-300K fully loaded cost
- Denmark engineer: $100-150K fully loaded (still high by global standards)
- India/Poland/Portugal engineer: $50-80K fully loaded
- **Arbitrage opportunity:** Move work to lower-cost regions, pocket the margin

**Why Denmark Specifically:**
- **Not the cheapest**, but offers:
  - High talent quality
  - Strong English proficiency
  - Compatible time zones with US (6-9 hour overlap possible)
  - Cultural alignment with US tech companies
  - EU access for GDPR-sensitive work
  - Less attrition than India/Eastern Europe
- It's often a "step down" in cost without the perceived quality risk of offshore

**Thoma Bravo's Approach (Based on Portfolio Patterns):**
1. **Acquire companies with existing international footprint** - leverage that immediately
2. **Hub strategy** - Don't distribute everywhere; pick 2-3 locations and scale
3. **Product team arbitrage** - Keep architects/senior ICs in US, move implementation to lower-cost
4. **Support/maintenance first** - Lower risk work moves offshore first
5. **Acquire regional capabilities** - Buy companies in target geographies rather than build

**What This Means for a VPE:**
- You'll likely be asked to present a "geo-optimization" plan within 6-12 months
- Expect targets like "30% of engineering spend in lower-cost regions by year 2"
- You'll need to decide: cut US heads and hire abroad, or attrition-based transition?
- Build relationships with good recruiting firms in target regions NOW

## Summary: The VPE Survival Guide

If you're taking a VPE role at a Thoma Bravo portfolio company with a $3M equity package:

1. **Understand you're being hired to execute cuts** - That's the job, not a side effect
2. **Model the equity realistically** - Understand waterfall, dilution, performance gates
3. **Build credibility fast** - You have 90 days to be seen as an insider, not a legacy holdover
4. **Get ahead of the playbook** - Propose restructuring before it's imposed on you
5. **Protect your A-players ruthlessly** - You'll need them to survive the transition
6. **Learn PE-speak** - EBITDA, Rule of 40, ARR, multiple expansion, hold period, IRR
7. **Negotiate your role clearly** - Are you here to optimize, or here to be optimized?

The $3M is real money, but it's payment for doing very hard, often unpopular work over 3-5 years. Know what you're signing up for.
