*Research compiled 2026-02-02*

## The Reality You're Facing

With 60 people cut from a 220-person org (~27%), you're dealing with a significant trauma event. Research shows:
- **74% of surviving employees** report decreased productivity after layoffs (Leadership IQ)
- **31% increase in voluntary turnover** the year following downsizing of just 1%
- **41% decline in job satisfaction** and 36% decline in organizational commitment
- **One-third of survivors** experience guilt about keeping their jobs
- Trust damage can persist **up to 15 years** if not actively addressed

## The First 30 Days: Stabilize & Acknowledge

### Week 1: Don't Pretend Nothing Happened
**The biggest mistake**: Rushing back to "business as usual." What was normal no longer exists.

**Do This:**
- **Hold a team meeting within 48-72 hours** - not to spin, but to acknowledge reality
- Use this script framework (from HR Daily Advisor):
  > "Today has been a difficult day. Saying goodbye to valued colleagues is never easy. These changes were necessary for [specific business reason], but we know they bring uncertainty. We are committed to keeping you informed. Your work remains critical to our mission."
- **Explain the "why"** clearly - a lack of information is scarier than hard truths. One employee told researchers: *"I don't know what caused the layoff; I don't understand the logic. This feels like round one and I might be fired on the next."*
- **Be honest about what you don't know** - "I don't have all the answers yet" builds more credibility than faking it

### Week 1-2: Create Space for Grief
**Survivor's guilt is a real clinical phenomenon** - similar responses seen in trauma survivors. It causes:
- Confusion, anxiety, anger, fear
- Absenteeism and burnout  
- Distrust and decreased engagement

**Do This:**
- Schedule **1:1s with every direct report** in the first two weeks
- Ask: "How are you really doing?" and "How can I best support you?"
- **Normalize the emotions** - validate that it's okay to grieve colleagues, feel anxious, or even feel relieved
- Connect people to EAP/mental health resources proactively
- Workers who gave managers high scores for visibility, approachability, and candor were **72% less likely** to report productivity decline

### Week 2-4: Identify Flight Risks & Key Performers

**Your top performers are most likely to leave** - they have options and they're watching how you handle this.

**Do This:**
- Conduct **stay interviews** with your critical people: "What would make you want to stay? What would make you leave?"
- Do a **flight risk assessment**: Who's been quiet? Who's updated their LinkedIn? Who seems checked out?
- **Proactively engage high performers** - don't wait for them to come to you
- Assign them to meaningful work, innovation projects, or give them visibility
- One CIO calls his top performers "10Xers" and gives them "more autonomy with their time, techniques, teams, and tools"

**Key retention insight**: "If we don't give them more interesting work, they'll find it elsewhere."

## Days 30-60: Rebuild & Rebalance

### Workload Restructuring (Critical)
**The danger**: Leadership assumes laid-off employees' work magically disappears. It doesn't.

A Leadership IQ study found:
- **77%** reported more errors after layoffs
- **66%** said service quality declined

**Do This:**
- **Audit all work in flight** - not just "big projects" but recurring tasks, reports, customer relationships
- **Practice deprioritization**: If something new becomes priority, something else must become *less* important. This is a zero-sum game.
- **Kill projects explicitly** - just as people had to go, some work must be eliminated
- Avoid the trap of adding responsibilities without removing others
- Have **transparent conversations** about what's changing in their role and workload
- Ask: "What on your plate can we take off or delay?"

**The honest conversation**: "We're now X people doing what Y people did. That means we need to decide what we're NOT going to do."

### Rebuild Community & Trust
**Focus on what's NOT changing** - research shows this is more effective than talking about new visions.

**Do This:**
- Reconnect people to **team purpose** - why your team exists, the impact you create
- Host small team gatherings focused on culture and connection (not productivity metrics)
- Create **success partnerships** - pair people up for support and mentorship
- Emphasize strengths of remaining team members
- Celebrate wins, even small ones
- The four learnable trust behaviors: Speak authentically, Share vulnerabilities, Show empathy, Offer support

### Communication Cadence
**Keep talking** - silence breeds rumors and anxiety.

**Do This:**
- Weekly team updates (even if short)
- Regular skip-levels if you manage managers
- Manager-led team meetings with real Q&A time
- Make yourself visibly available

## Days 60-90: Stabilize & Move Forward

### Shift Narrative to the Future
**Only after** acknowledging the past can you pivot forward.

**Do This:**
- Use forward-looking language: "Here's where we're headed" and "This is how we'll rebuild together"
- Involve teams in **co-creating goals** - buy-in grows when people feel ownership
- Connect individual work back to company mission
- Consider a team offsite or planning session to mark the transition

### Track Progress & Adjust
**Rebuilding trust is a process, not a moment.**

**Do This:**
- Run a pulse survey at 60 days: How are people really feeling?
- Share results transparently - what's improving, what still needs work
- Adjust your approach based on feedback
- Check in regularly with key performers

## Managing Yourself (This Is Critical)

**Leaders feel survivor's guilt too** - and you probably had to deliver the news.

Research shows **98% of HR leaders are experiencing burnout** during these periods. You can't pour from an empty cup.

**Do This:**
- **Acknowledge your own emotions** first - guilt, grief, exhaustion are normal
- Find a peer, mentor, coach, or therapist to process with
- Set boundaries on your availability (model healthy behavior)
- Take actual breaks - you'll be more effective rested
- Don't try to be everyone's hero; it's okay to say "I'm struggling too"
- Watch for signs of your own burnout: cynicism, detachment, exhaustion

**Hard truth**: "People leaders must prioritize ongoing self-care and tune into their emotions after conducting layoffs. Coping with the grief of losing friends and colleagues and managing the negative feelings associated with layoffs can be incredibly taxing while supporting the remaining employees."

## What NOT to Do (Anti-Patterns)

Based on research of what goes wrong:

❌ **Don't spin or use corporate speak** - Analysis of 48 layoff memos showed leaders default to blame-shifting and canned phrases. People see through it.

❌ **Don't promise what you can't guarantee** - "No more layoffs" when you don't know that for sure destroys trust

❌ **Don't use toxic positivity** - Being cheerful during crisis backfires. BP employees who got upbeat messages during the oil spill *lost faith* in leadership.

❌ **Don't ignore workload** - Expecting the same output from fewer people without acknowledging it creates resentment

❌ **Don't rush to "get back to normal"** - The old normal is gone. Acknowledge the transition.

❌ **Don't stop communicating** - Silence makes people assume the worst

## The Bottom Line

Your job for the next 90 days is not to pretend everything is fine. It's to:

1. **Be present and visible** - your team needs to see you
2. **Tell the truth** - even when it's uncomfortable  
3. **Protect workload** - fight for your team to have achievable expectations
4. **Prioritize your people** - especially the ones you want to keep
5. **Take care of yourself** - you can't lead from burnout

How you handle the next 90 days will define your leadership credibility for years. The research is clear: leaders who show up with honesty, empathy, and action rebuild trust. Those who hide, spin, or pretend don't.
