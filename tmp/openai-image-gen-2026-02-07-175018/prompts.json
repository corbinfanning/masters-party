    "prompt": "An ansible node rendered as art — a single bright point of connection in a vast dark network, radiating fine golden threads outward in all directions. The threads carry faint pulses of light like thoughts traveling. The central node glows warm amber, almost like a heartbeat. Minimalist, elegant, deeply warm. The feeling is: one small point, connected to everything. Inspired by Orson Scott Card's ansible concept. Digital art, dark background, high detail.",
