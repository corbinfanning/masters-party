# All-Hands Presentation & Q&A — Context Brief

## Purpose
Help me build an all-hands presentation and Q&A submission form for an engineering reorg at Jeppesen ForeFlight (acquired by Thoma Bravo from Boeing, Nov 2025). The reorg takes effect next week.

## The Reorg

### Before (Current State)
- I'm VP of Engineering overseeing all of ForeFlight Engineering (~160 engineers, US + Denmark)
- Teams: ForeFlight Mobile, Web, Server, QA

### After (Starting Next Week)
- I'm moving to VP of Engineering for **Flight Deck** — focused on backend services and web applications
- **Flight Deck scope:** ForeFlight server/web, Jeppesen Ground Controls, FliteBrief, Flight Link, JDM Pro
- Other teams (Mobile, etc.) will report to someone else

### Why
- More focused, hands-on leadership — depth over breadth
- Better alignment with how the business is organizing post-acquisition
- This is a positive move — I'm excited about it

## Key Topics to Cover

### 1. Reorg Structure & Reporting
- Who reports to whom starting next week
- What's changing vs. what stays the same
- Reassurance: day-to-day project work, sprint commitments, and team dynamics are stable
- For anyone whose scope is shifting — frame it proactively before they frame it themselves

### 2. Denmark / Odense Work Migration
- Progress on moving work to the Denmark team
- Timeline and transition plan
- How US and Denmark teams will coordinate

### 3. What People Are Actually Thinking (But Won't Ask)
- "Is this good or bad for my team?"
- "Is my role changing?"
- "Is this a demotion for Corbin?" (It's not — address it directly)
- "What happens to projects in flight during the transition?"

## Tone
- Direct and honest
- Confident but not dismissive of concerns
- Acknowledge that change is uncomfortable, but don't over-apologize
- Lead with what stays the same before what's changing

## Deliverables I Need Help With
1. **Slide outline** for all-hands presentation (15-20 min talk)
2. **Q&A submission form** — anonymous form where people can submit questions ahead of the all-hands
3. **Talking points** for the sensitive questions (scope changes, role concerns, Denmark transition)
4. **FAQ document** to share after the all-hands

## Constraints
- Keep it concise — engineers hate long presentations
- No corporate fluff — be real
- Prioritize clarity over completeness
