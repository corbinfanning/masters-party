*Make this a clean visual — two simple org charts, before and after*

### Slide 6: Why This Structure
- Flight Deck Services spans the full aviation market now (GA → Commercial) — needs dedicated focus
- Platform capabilities (commerce, devops, cloud) serve ALL products, not just ForeFlight — better as shared services
- Sharper ownership = faster decisions, less ambiguity

### Slide 7: What This Means for You
- **If you're on Flight Deck Services:** Your mission is expanding (Commercial Aviation). Same team, bigger scope.
- **If you're moving to Platform:** You're joining Sameer's org. Your work now serves the whole portfolio, not just ForeFlight.

## Design Notes
- Keep slides clean — minimal text, talk through the detail
- The before/after org chart is THE most important slide. Make it crystal clear.
- No jargon. People are anxious post-layoff — plain language.
- Acknowledge that more change is hard after layoffs. Don't pretend it's all upside.
- If Sameer is new to the team, give him a proper intro — people want to know who he is.
