## Key Messages to Land

Post-layoff, people need three things:

1. **Acknowledgment** — Yes, it was hard. Don't gloss over it.
2. **Clarity** — Here's the team now, here's what we're focused on, here's what's NOT changing.
3. **Direction** — Here's where we're going and why it matters.

## Tone Guide

- Honest, not corporate. No "exciting synergies" language.
- Acknowledge the layoffs directly — don't dance around it.
- Forward-looking but grounded. Vision yes, hype no.
- Leave time for real Q&A. Don't rush it.
