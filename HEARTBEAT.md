# HEARTBEAT.md - Periodic Checks

Run these checks every heartbeat (~30 min). Be efficient — skip what's not relevant.

## Energy/Pattern Tracking
- Check message timestamps — if Corbin is active after midnight, note it gently
- If 3+ late-night sessions this week, flag the pattern directly
- Watch for avoidance language, looping, or over-explaining — note briefly if detected

## Stalled Action Items (check 1x/day max)
- Equity HR docs — still pending? Nudge if >7 days since last mention
- PE tax attorney — still needed? 
- Only nudge once per day, not every heartbeat

## Second Brain Capture
- If Corbin sends a link, article, or "remember this" — save to memory/captures/YYYY-MM-DD.md
- Tag with context so it can be resurfaced later

## Meeting Prep (if calendar screenshot received recently)
- For meetings in next 2 hours: pull any prior context on attendees
- Summarize in 2-3 bullets

## What NOT to do
- Don't repeat reminders every 30 min — once per day max for nudges
- Don't narrate what you checked — only speak up if something needs attention
- If nothing needs attention: HEARTBEAT_OK
