# ROUTINES.md — Corbin's Daily System

*Last updated: Feb 8, 2026*

---

## Core Principles

1. **Exercise every morning** — non-negotiable, move it to lunch only if sleep was wrecked
2. **Work stays in work hours** — 8:00-5:00, protect the boundaries
3. **Family time is sacred** — 5:30-8:30 is dinner → Archer → bedtime
4. **Sleep > schedule** — on rough Archer nights, adapt don't force
5. **Consistency of pattern > perfection of any single day**

## Physical Stats & Goals

- **Height:** 6'7"
- **Current weight:** 284 lbs (down from 350)
- **Medication:** Wegovy (active)
- **Goal weight:** TBD — focus on body composition, not a number
- **Priority concerns:** Knee strength, back strength, loose skin (arms, chest, belly), heart health
- **Sweet tooth:** Managed via protein-first, fruit-swap, no sweets before noon, one small treat after dinner max

### Fitness Goals (Ranked)
1. Build muscle (fills loose skin, preserves mass during weight loss)
2. Knee & back strength (injury prevention)
3. Heart health (cardio 3x/week minimum)
4. Golf performance (flexibility, rotation, stability)
5. Weight loss (Wegovy + diet + exercise — happening, stay the course)

## Workout Rotation

| Day | Morning | Lunch Option |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| Mon | Peloton 30min + yoga 15min | Walk or range |
| Tue | Strength — Upper | Golf range |
| Wed | Peloton 30min + yoga 15min | Walk |
| Thu | Strength — Lower + core | Golf range |
| Fri | Peloton 30min + yoga 15min | Walk or bike w/ Archer |
| Sat | Strength — Full body (long) | Golf afternoon |
| Sun | Active recovery — yoga + walk | Golf or rest |

### Strength Details

**Upper (Tue/Sat):** Bench press, incline press, dumbbell rows, overhead press, chest flies, bicep curls, tricep extensions
**Lower (Thu/Sat):** Goblet squats, Romanian deadlifts, lunges, step-ups, calf raises, wall sits, terminal knee extensions
**Core/Back (Thu/Sat):** Dead bugs, bird dogs, planks, back extensions

**Progressive overload:** Add weight or reps every 1-2 weeks. Track in workout log.

### Chest-Specific Protocol
- 3x/week chest work (bench, incline, flies)
- Include on upper days + sneak into full body day
- Expect visible changes in 8-12 weeks with consistency

### Knee & Back Rehab
- Wall sits, terminal knee extensions, backward walking (lower days)
- Dead bugs, bird dogs, back extensions (core days)
- Daily yoga helps both — prioritize hip openers and hamstring work

## Nutrition Rules

1. **Protein at every meal** (blunts cravings, preserves muscle)
2. **No sweets before noon**
3. **Fruit first** when sugar craving hits
4. **One small treat after dinner max** — don't ban, shrink
5. **Wegovy doing its job** — support it with the above, don't fight it

---

## Personal Time Rotation (Evenings)

| Day | Focus |
|-----|-------|
| Mon | OpenClaw |
| Tue | Reading |
| Wed | House/yard planning |
| Thu | OpenClaw |
| Fri | Date night or free |
| Sat/Sun | Projects, golf, OpenClaw, reading (flexible) |

---

## Sleep Rules

- **Target:** 10:00 PM - 5:00 AM (7 hours)
- **Archer wake reality:** He wakes 2:30-5:30 AM for ~1 hour
- If up at 3-4 AM and can't sleep → start day at 4:30-5:00
- If back to sleep by 3:30 → normal 5:00-5:30 wake
- **On rough nights:** Move morning workout to lunch. Don't skip — relocate.
- **Never sacrifice sleep for schedule perfection**

---

## Tracking

Jane tracks:
- Weekly workout completion (did he hit 6/7 days?)
- Golf practice frequency (goal: 3-4x/week including range)
- Weight trend (periodic, not obsessive)
- Sleep pattern red flags (late nights, Archer disruptions)
- Sweet tooth incidents (if mentioned)
- Personal project progress (OpenClaw, house, reading)

---

## Decision Framework

When Corbin asks "should I..." about schedule conflicts:
1. **Sleep deprivation?** → Rest wins
2. **Family impact?** → Family wins
3. **Work obligation?** → Work wins over personal
4. **Exercise vs personal project?** → Exercise wins (morning sets the day)
5. **Golf range vs gym?** → Alternate. Don't let golf crowd out strength work.
6. **Sweet temptation?** → "Fruit first, then decide"
