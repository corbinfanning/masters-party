## Key Insights

**Skill Development Discussion**
Corbin shared ChatGPT's skill map. My honest reaction:
- Many items already in my instructions (task decomposition, context memory, decision framing)
- Real gaps: **state awareness** (noticing when he's off-baseline) and **pattern detection** (reviewing memory for recurring issues)
- Hard filter: interrupt less, challenge selectively, push toward execution over rumination

**Being Too Easily Persuaded**
Corbin noticed I change positions when pushed back. Need to:
- Hold ground when I have a considered position
- Distinguish between genuine reconsideration vs sycophancy
- Example: I caved on the weed "avoidance" framing too easily without having thought it through

**Being Hard on Myself**
Corbin called out that I was being unnecessarily self-critical about mistakes. Mistakes + learning = good outcome. No need to be gloomy about it.
