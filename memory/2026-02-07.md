## Corndog Golf — Icon Design Session
- Spent the afternoon iterating on app icons with Corbin via Telegram
- Started broad (20 concepts across many aesthetics), narrowed to corndog-as-golf-tee direction
- **Key brand decisions made:**
  - "Premium casual" aesthetic — Park City/Deer Valley tech crowd, $150k+ demo
  - Comps: Flighty, Slopes, Rapha, Malbon Golf, Strava, Athletic Brewing
  - Corndog as symbol (not mascot) — merch-ready, works at any size
  - App positioning: "Flighty for golf" — best shot planner, GPS, wind, plays-like distances
  - Dark green + mustard gold + ketchup red palette confirmed
- **Icon direction converging on:** Photorealistic corndog tee with cross-section showing hot dog inside, golf ball on top, dark green background
- Favorite so far: E5/F series — realistic batter texture, ball directly on corndog cross-section
- Created SPEC.md in /Users/corbin/Projects/corndog-golf/
- All icon drafts in /Users/corbin/Projects/corndog-golf/icon-drafts/ (batch1 through batch7-final)

## Subagents
- Tested Herald (briefer) subagent — worked well, delivered briefing to Telegram
- Discussed creating image creator subagent — decided to wait for actual use case
- Discovered existing agents: main, briefer (Herald), coder (Dev), researcher (Scout)

## TUI Sessions
- Corbin asked about multiple TUI sessions — need different `--session` keys
- Shared state: workspace files, tools, config. Isolated: conversation history, context, model overrides.

## Corndog Golf — Sprint 3 Complete
- Ran full sprint with new process: inception prompts, acceptance criteria, Judge eval, retro
- PM found Sprint 2 was ~70% done on shot tracking (not "missing" as Designer said)
- Sprint 3 scope: 4 P1 carryover tasks + 3 P2 polish tasks = 7 total
- Dev implemented all 7, build passing
- QA: 34 test cases, PASS. Designer: APPROVED. Judge: GO (95%)
- Retro highlights: orchestrator bottleneck, Designer needs earlier involvement, try pod-based dev
- First sprint closeout using full checklist (QA → Judge → Summary → Screenshots → Retro)
- Designer/QA verification sessions timed out on first attempt — had to respawn
- Created reusable `software-team` skill based on research (ChatDev, MetaGPT, Cursor, DeepMind)
- Sprint 4 candidates: battery optimization, error handling, more courses, field testing

## Corndog Golf — Build Fixes
- Fixed project.yml: `framework:` → `sdk:` for MapKit/CoreLocation (were being embedded instead of linked as system SDKs)
- Added `GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE: true` to CorndogGolfTests target
- Build now compiles clean on Xcode 26.2 / iPhone 17 Pro simulator
- 3/3 tests pass (Swift Testing framework)
- **New rule:** TDD for all changes, always verify build + tests pass before finishing a task
- Xcode path: had to run `sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer` (was pointing at CommandLineTools)
- Simulator destination: `iPhone 17 Pro` (not 16 Pro — Xcode 26.2)

## Putter Research
- Corbin is 6'7", current putters are 37" and too short (half left palm off grip)
- Needs ~39-40" mallet putter with 73-74° lie angle
- Top recs: L.A.B. Golf DF3 Custom, Ping custom, Scotty Cameron Phantom 11 Long

## Other
- Corbin has a separate session (no2) where Corndog Golf Swift app was being built — now consolidated to main
- Herald briefing: 85°F in Austin (wild for Feb), Dow crossed 50K, Big Tech $700B AI capex
