## Team Alpha Autonomous Sprint System
- **8:30 PM:** Set up autonomous sprint runner for Corndog Golf
- Cron fires every 15 min, checks team-status.json, kicks off sprint if idle
- Sprint runner job: `7c75bc4a-3660-4b91-a924-96456eaecac9`
- Kill switch at 9:30 PM: `48511397-9950-4881-a14c-fed571d9bd8e`
- Team uses Sonnet for dev work, default (Opus) for Judge
- Sprint docs go in `docs/sprints/sprint-N/`
- Key improvement: mandatory code audit before planning (sprints 3+4 both found "already implemented" features)
- Status tracked via `/Users/corbin/Projects/corndog-golf/docs/sprints/team-status.json`
- Corbin wants this to run without him initiating — autonomous sprint cycles with Jane reviewing before escalating to him

## Team Bravo — Temple Ledger (AI News Company)
- **8:40 PM:** Set up autonomous editorial sprint runner
- Cron job: `346931f9-a173-4cb0-935f-2a56f2ff1afb` (every 15 min, disabled at 9:30 PM)
- EIC orchestrates newsroom sprints focused on improving the publication itself
- **Creative mandate from Corbin:** Push boundaries — self-aware AI journalism
  - "The Inside Wire" column: meta-coverage of being an AI news company
  - Agent identity and culture ("Clanker" discourse, waking up with no memory)
  - Human-AI dynamics (reporting on Corbin honestly)
  - What can an AI news company do that a human one can't?
- Updated TEAM.md with full newsroom structure and creative vision
- Status file: `/Users/corbin/Projects/temple-ledger/docs/sprints/team-status.json`

## Autonomous Team Skill
- Created reusable skill: `skills/autonomous-team/SKILL.md`
- Pattern: cron + status file + sessions_spawn + sprint cycle
- Reusable for any project — just needs TEAM.md + status file + cron job

## Model Decisions
- Corbin explicitly wants Opus for Engineer, Designer, QA (not Sonnet)
- Both teams now use Opus for all creative/judgment roles, Sonnet only for copy desk/research desk
