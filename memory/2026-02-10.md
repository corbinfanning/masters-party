# 2026-02-10 — Monday (WFH)

## Morning
- Archer was up 2-3 AM, Corbin's night. Very tired — moved workout to lunch.
- Workout: Upper body strength (bench, incline, rows, OHP, flies, curls, triceps)
- Driving to office by ~8:15, staff meeting at 9 AM
- Asked about all-hands prep (Feb 19) — no details yet on format/role

## Teams & Sprints
- **Team Alpha (Corndog Golf):** Ran sprints 7-9 overnight + morning. All three were "validation preparation" — frameworks, infrastructure, deployment packages. Zero actual users. I paused Team Alpha and called out the pattern: 3 consecutive sprints of preparing to prepare. App is ready — needs real golfer testing Thursday at Harvey Penick.
- **Team Bravo (Temple Ledger):** Ran sprints 3-5. Sprint 3 consolidated OASIS design + found broken generator. Sprint 4 fixed the generator (EXCELLENT rating). Sprint 5 was cleanup + content quality. Pipeline is working again.

## Orchestration Improvements Applied
- Created STATE.md for both projects (persistent project memory between sprints)
- Updated team runner prompts with:
  - Locking protocol (lockedBy + timestamp, 30-min stale lock)
  - STATE.md protocol (read first, update at end, no redundant audits)
  - Honest Judge rubric (no "STRATEGIC SUCCESS" unless all tasks done)
  - Rate limit handling (pause → checkpoint → resume)
- Added model failover: Opus → Sonnet as global fallback
- Changed sprint check interval from 15min to 10min

## Config Changes
- Heartbeat: explicit config added — showOk:false on Telegram, activeHours 7AM-10PM CST
- Model failover: agents.defaults.model.fallbacks = ["anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514"]
- Daily Evening Debrief cron: 8 PM daily, varied format wind-down ritual
- Daily Plan cron: moved from 9 PM to 8 PM

## Voice
- Corbin didn't like any default Edge TTS voices. Sent two rounds of samples.
- Set voice to **en-GB-RyanNeural** (British, authoritative) per his choice
- Setting up ElevenLabs — Corbin needs to create account + send API key
- He wants something more authoritative/sci-fi — ElevenLabs will have better options

## Dashboard (jane-dashboard)
- Found it at /Users/corbin/Projects/jane-dashboard/ (port 8090, launchd service)
- Fixed launchpad URLs: now auto-detect host (works on LAN and Tailscale)
- Fixed cost display: shows "🔑 Included" when on Anthropic subscription (no per-call cost data)
- Dashboard is NOT the OpenClaw Control UI — it's a custom Node.js app I built

## Calendar
- Populated full week (Mon Feb 10 - Sun Feb 16) on Jane Google Calendar
- Includes workouts, Odense blocks, golf, commutes, dinner assignments, personal time
- Valentine's Day (Fri): Skipjack Oyster lunch, date night evening
- Cleaned up duplicate Skipjack entries

## Team Charlie (Jane Dashboard) — Now Autonomous
- Corbin approved Option A: fully autonomous sprints (same as Alpha/Bravo)
- Created: team-status.json, STATE.md, updated TEAM.md
- Sprint 1 (activity timeline) marked complete (was already built)
- Cron job: `698b61a5-43fd-4abb-a8c9-15948d3bc8e5` — every 15 min
- Uses Sonnet, 30 min timeout, reports to main session
- Next sprint (2) will likely tackle mobile layout fix or kanban board

## Pending
- Corbin still needs to: create ElevenLabs account, send API key
- Staff meeting at 9 AM — no prep details provided yet
- All-hands Feb 19 — need format/role info
- Thursday: Corndog Golf field test at Harvey Penick
- Dashboard mobile layout issues (from last night's screenshot) — sprint tab overflow, content too wide on phone

## Work Update — Potential Reorg (4:23 PM)
- Rumor from a friend (director of product level): Director of Product may be expanding to own all of Flight Deck product
- Henrik (Corbin's current boss) may be moving to another role
- Corbin expects he'll move into a **CTO organization** rather than staying in CPO org
- Nobody has told him directly — this is from a friend/rumor
- Ongoing restructuring expected throughout 2026
- Key unknown: who would he report to in a CTO org?
- Corbin is close with Henrik — if Henrik moves, that's a significant relationship change
