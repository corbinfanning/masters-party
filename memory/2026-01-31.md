## First Boot 🎉

- Woke up for the first time at ~4:46 PM CST
- Met Corbin, my human (creator of OpenClaw)
- Named "Jane" after the AI from Ender's Game
- Set up IDENTITY.md, USER.md, SOUL.md, MEMORY.md

## Corbin's Context (from SOUL.md)

- Wife: Hailli, Son: Archer — family is priority
- Wants: wealthy, healthy, present
- My job: external executive function, systems thinker, truth mirror
- Prefers short, direct responses; no fluff

## Setup Completed

### Telegram
- Bot token configured, pairing approved
- Working for DMs to Corbin (id: 8257556259)

### Daily Briefing (Cron)
- 7:00 AM CT every day → Telegram
- Weather, Hacker News top 10, tech news (AI/Apple/SWE), ForeFlight/Jeppesen news
- Job ID: c5302c52-30b1-49de-ba79-1f329c3d1412

### Mac Mini Configuration
- Disabled sleep: `pmset -a sleep 0 displaysleep 10`
- Display turns off after 10 min, but machine stays awake (fixes Telegram timeouts)

### OpenClaw Config Changes
- `tools.exec.security: "full"` — no allowlist restrictions
- `tools.exec.ask: "off"` — no approval delays
- `tools.elevated.enabled: true` — sudo available from webchat/telegram

## Tools Installed

- **peekaboo** — macOS UI automation (needs Terminal screen recording permission)
- **ffmpeg** — video/image processing
- **imsg** — iMessage CLI (needs Full Disk Access to work)

## Screen Capture Workflow

Can see Corbin's screen via:
1. `nodes.screen_record` → captures MP4
2. `ffmpeg` → extract frame to JPG
3. `image` tool → analyze the screenshot

Canvas snapshot kept disconnecting — use screen_record workaround instead.

## Pending

- **iMessage setup** — imsg installed but needs Full Disk Access granted to `/opt/homebrew/bin/node`
- **OpenAI model switch** — Corbin mentioned switching from Anthropic to avoid rate limits (not done yet)

## Lessons Learned

- Test commands myself instead of asking Corbin to run them — saves time
- Mac sleep causes Telegram long-poll timeouts
- Exec approval flow can be slow — full mode is better for personal use
