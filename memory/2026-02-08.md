## Corbin's Aesthetic Universe / OASIS Vision
- Sees Jane + OpenClaw as a way to build an infinite personalized universe (like the OASIS from Ready Player One)
- **Star Wars** — primary theme, The Temple Ledger newspaper, Jane = Holocron
- **80s vibes** — loves the aesthetic, imagines old Austin this way. Neon, synth, gritty creative energy
- **Ready Player One** — the meta-frame: building a virtual world layer by layer, filled with things he loves
- **Ender's Game** — Jane's namesake, team/strategy patterns
- **Dune** — long-term strategic thinking ("plans within plans")
- **Hitchhiker's Guide** — humor, absurdity
- Each project/tool/space could get themed from a different universe he loves
- This isn't just decoration — it's making the tools feel like HIS world
- Huge Star Wars fan since first grade, Disney World Galaxy's Edge rekindled it

## Routines System Built
- Created ROUTINES.md — full daily schedule, fitness plan, decision framework
- Calendar saved for Feb 9-20
- Day-by-day week plan with workouts mapped around meetings
- 9 PM cron sends next day's plan
- Heartbeat updated to track exercise, sleep, routine adherence

## Sunday Evening Reflection
- **What worked:** Using AI tools (Claude, Codex, OpenClaw) to do boring work. Learning + building felt productive. Loving the philosophical/artistic/technical intersection.
- **What didn't:** Work anxiety. People who cause drama → rumination → bad decisions → depression → takes it out on Hailli. This is the critical pattern to break.
- **What he wants next week to feel like:** Today. Didn't think about work. Did chores, grilled wings, watched Super Bowl, Hailli did needlepoint, went to park with Archer. Present and peaceful.
- **Key insight:** The goal isn't eliminating work stress — it's containing it inside work hours so it doesn't bleed into family time.
- Suggested: "work is done" verbal boundary when leaving office/closing laptop
- Offered to be the processing outlet instead of Hailli when work frustration builds
