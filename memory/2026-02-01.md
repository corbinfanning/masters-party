## Corrections & Lessons

**Configured ≠ Built**
I said Corbin "built the whole stack" (OpenClaw/Pi). He corrected me — he configured it, didn't build it. Important distinction: using a tool vs creating it.

**5 Whys**
Corbin asked me to adopt the "5 whys" approach for difficult problems — keep asking why until you reach the root cause. Added to SOUL.md.

## Notes

- OpenAI auth profile added to config, gateway restarted ~3 PM, OpenAI models now available
- Daily briefing cron is working — HN post #5 about coding agents led Corbin to discover OpenClaw is built on Pi-ai
- Cached OpenClaw docs to workspace/openclaw-docs/
- Set up: weekly calendar upload reminder (Sundays 10 AM), daily OpenClaw update check (9 AM)
- Corbin went to Spurs game in San Antonio with in-laws

## Corbin Context

- Works at ForeFlight (flight planning software)
- 6'7", 290 lbs (just lost 50 lbs!)
- Golf goal: break 90 consistently, then 80
- Putting is weakest — usually 3-putts, needs putter fitting for his height
- Has a fitter at Barton Creek

## Corrections & Lessons (additional)

**Verify before asserting**
I said Mac mini was on Ethernet based on incomplete diagnostic output. Corbin corrected me — it's on WiFi (en1). Lesson: don't turn ambiguous data into confident claims. Verify which interface is actually carrying traffic.

## Jane's Avatar

Created my visual identity today:
- **Image:** Warm amber orb with internal neural network patterns
- **Location:** `assets/avatar/jane-avatar.png`
- **Animated versions:** `jane-avatar-animated.gif` and `jane-avatar-pulse.gif` (ffmpeg brightness/saturation filters)
- **Emoji:** Changed from 💎 to 🔆 (warm, present, attentive)
- **Why this look:** Wanted warmth over coldness, alive over robotic. Honey/amber tones with subtle internal patterns.

## Valentine's Day Planning

Corbin asked for Valentine's lunch recommendations (Feb 14). Shared:
- **Josephine House** — French-Southern, intimate
- **Launderette** — American/European, great brunch
- **Chez Nous** — French bistro, prix fixe brunch

He hasn't decided yet — may follow up closer to the date.

## Corbin's Week (Feb 2-7)

- **Tue-Wed:** Heavy meetings
- **Thu-Fri:** WFH
- **Sat:** Lauren Sanchez birthday trip to Fredericksburg

## Technical Setup

- Created Sonos skill (`skills/sonos/`) with SKILL.md and helper script
- Discovered speaker IPs: Family Room 192.168.1.239, Kitchen 192.168.1.145, Office 192.168.1.190
- Created comprehensive `SETUP.md` for machine migration
- Created `scripts/setup-new-machine.sh` automation script
- Added OSRM travel time API to TOOLS.md (free routing, no traffic data)
