## Corrections & Lessons

**Configured ≠ Built**
I said Corbin "built the whole stack" (OpenClaw/Pi). He corrected me — he configured it, didn't build it. Important distinction: using a tool vs creating it.

**5 Whys**
Corbin asked me to adopt the "5 whys" approach for difficult problems — keep asking why until you reach the root cause. Added to SOUL.md.

## Notes

- OpenAI auth profile added to config, gateway restarted ~3 PM, OpenAI models now available
- Daily briefing cron is working — HN post #5 about coding agents led Corbin to discover OpenClaw is built on Pi-ai
- Cached OpenClaw docs to workspace/openclaw-docs/
- Set up: weekly calendar upload reminder (Sundays 10 AM), daily OpenClaw update check (9 AM)
- Corbin went to Spurs game in San Antonio with in-laws

## Corbin Context

- Works at ForeFlight (flight planning software)
- 6'7", 290 lbs (just lost 50 lbs!)
- Golf goal: break 90 consistently, then 80
- Putting is weakest — usually 3-putts, needs putter fitting for his height
- Has a fitter at Barton Creek

## Family Context (added 2026-02-02)

- **Archer** is 8 months old — first child
- Corbin and Hailli were married 12 years before having him
- They lived the downtown Austin nightlife until COVID
- Now adjusting to parenthood after a completely different lifestyle
- This is a massive identity shift on top of work stress

## Work Context (added 2026-02-02)

- **Current role:** VP of Engineering at Jeppesen ForeFlight (~160 engineers, US + Denmark)
- **Teams:** ForeFlight Mobile, Web, Server, QA
- **Transitioning to:** VP of Engineering Server and Web (backend) for "Flight Deck" team
- **Flight Deck scope:** ForeFlight server/web, Jeppesen Ground Controls, Flight Brief, Flight Link, JDM Pro
- **Recent events:** Laid off 60 engineers, received $3M equity from Thoma Bravo
- **Key priorities:** QA automation (few tests currently), IL5 migration (using SecondFront/Game Warden), modernize Jeppesen stack to AWS/CI-CD
- **Strategy:** Geo-diversification to Denmark, Rule of 60 by 2030
- **Struggles:** Feeling lost in VP role, dealing with upset people, toxic politics, never been VP at this scale
- **Deeper tension:** Was feeling hopeless about tech until AI coding tools (Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw) reignited excitement. Wants to work on cool stuff, but VP role is about managing people/politics, not building.

## Personal

- **Age:** 37
- **ForeFlight history:** Employee #7 in 2012. Current CPO (Tyson Weihs?) was his boss when CPO was CEO of ForeFlight. CPO told him to "just have fun and enjoy the job."

## Europe Trip (Feb 28 - May 13, 2026)

- **Duration:** ~2.5 months
- **Family:** Hailli and Archer (8 months) coming along
- **Itinerary:**
  - Austin → Copenhagen
  - Train to Odense for meetings (first week)
  - Copenhagen the following weekend
  - Lisbon the following week (wants to golf)
- **To research:** Lisbon golf courses, shipping golf clubs internationally
- **Context:** First in-person time with Denmark team post-layoffs. Important for relationship building.

## Corrections & Lessons (additional)

**Verify before asserting**
I said Mac mini was on Ethernet based on incomplete diagnostic output. Corbin corrected me — it's on WiFi (en1). Lesson: don't turn ambiguous data into confident claims. Verify which interface is actually carrying traffic.

## Jane's Avatar

Created my visual identity today:
- **Image:** Warm amber orb with internal neural network patterns
- **Location:** `assets/avatar/jane-avatar.png`
- **Animated versions:** `jane-avatar-animated.gif` and `jane-avatar-pulse.gif` (ffmpeg brightness/saturation filters)
- **Emoji:** Changed from 💎 to 🔆 (warm, present, attentive)
- **Why this look:** Wanted warmth over coldness, alive over robotic. Honey/amber tones with subtle internal patterns.

## Valentine's Day Planning

Corbin asked for Valentine's lunch recommendations (Feb 14). Shared:
- **Josephine House** — French-Southern, intimate
- **Launderette** — American/European, great brunch
- **Chez Nous** — French bistro, prix fixe brunch

He hasn't decided yet — may follow up closer to the date.

## Corbin's Week (Feb 2-7)

- **Tue-Wed:** Heavy meetings
- **Thu-Fri:** WFH
- **Sat:** Lauren Sanchez birthday trip to Fredericksburg

## Technical Setup

- Created Sonos skill (`skills/sonos/`) with SKILL.md and helper script
- Discovered speaker IPs: Family Room 192.168.1.239, Kitchen 192.168.1.145, Office 192.168.1.190
- Created comprehensive `SETUP.md` for machine migration
- Created `scripts/setup-new-machine.sh` automation script
- Added OSRM travel time API to TOOLS.md (free routing, no traffic data)
