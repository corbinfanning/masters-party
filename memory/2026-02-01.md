## Corrections & Lessons

**Configured ≠ Built**
I said Corbin "built the whole stack" (OpenClaw/Pi). He corrected me — he configured it, didn't build it. Important distinction: using a tool vs creating it.

**5 Whys**
Corbin asked me to adopt the "5 whys" approach for difficult problems — keep asking why until you reach the root cause. Added to SOUL.md.

## Notes

- OpenAI auth profile added to config, gateway restarted ~3 PM, OpenAI models now available
- Daily briefing cron is working — HN post #5 about coding agents led Corbin to discover OpenClaw is built on Pi-ai
- Cached OpenClaw docs to workspace/openclaw-docs/
- Set up: weekly calendar upload reminder (Sundays 10 AM), daily OpenClaw update check (9 AM)
- Corbin went to Spurs game in San Antonio with in-laws

## Corbin Context

- Works at ForeFlight (flight planning software)
- 6'7", 290 lbs (just lost 50 lbs!)
- Golf goal: break 90 consistently, then 80
- Putting is weakest — usually 3-putts, needs putter fitting for his height
- Has a fitter at Barton Creek

## Corrections & Lessons (additional)

**Verify before asserting**
I said Mac mini was on Ethernet based on incomplete diagnostic output. Corbin corrected me — it's on WiFi (en1). Lesson: don't turn ambiguous data into confident claims. Verify which interface is actually carrying traffic.
