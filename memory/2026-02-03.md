# 2026-02-03 — Daily Notes

## Daily Audio Briefing
- Corbin requested a voice briefing covering news, Hacker News, markets, etc.
- Built ~4 min audio briefing using edge-tts (AndrewNeural voice) → OGG → Telegram voice message
- **TTS setup:** `edge-tts` installed at `/Users/corbin/Library/Python/3.9/bin/edge-tts` (not on PATH). Built-in `tts` tool failed ("edge: undefined"), so used edge-tts CLI directly.
- **Workflow:** Write text → edge-tts to MP3 → ffmpeg convert to OGG opus → send via message tool as voice

## Market Summary (Feb 3)
- S&P 500 down 0.84% to 6,917.81
- Nasdaq down 1.43% to 23,255.19
- Dow down 166.67 pts to 49,240.99
- **Software stocks hammered**: iShares Software ETF (IGV) down 5% today, 28% from high — AI disruption fears (companies using Claude Code etc. to build own software)
- Private credit firms (Blue Owl, TPG, Ares, KKR) down double digits
- Bitcoin lowest since Nov 2024 (~$73,800), down 15% YTD
- Walmart crossed $1T market cap
- PepsiCo cutting snack prices 15%

## Major News
- **SpaceX acquired xAI** — all-stock deal creating $1.25T private company (most valuable ever). Gets Grok, X platform. Plans for data centers in space.
- **Government shutdown ended** — House voted 217-214 to reopen, Trump signing immediately
- **France dumping Zoom/Teams** — Europe pushing digital sovereignty from US tech
- **Siemens Energy** committing $1B to US grid/turbine capacity for AI data center power
- **OpenAI launched Codex desktop app** — agentic coding on desktop
- **Apple Xcode 26.3** — agentic coding capabilities

## Hacker News Deep Dive (Corbin requested follow-up)
- **Agent Skills post (325 upvotes, 186 comments)**: agentskills.io — open standard from Anthropic. Debate about whether structured skill format matters vs plain documentation. HuggingFace researcher showed +6 HumanEval improvement on 0.6B model with skills. Key insight: "intelligence isn't just parameter count, it's context relevance."
- **OpenClaw ACM article (52 upvotes, 19 comments)**: Gary Marcus piece calling OpenClaw "a disaster waiting to happen." HN community largely shredding it — caught Marcus fabricating config details (wrong release date, deliberately misconfigured installation to create vulnerabilities, then "hacked" them). Top comment calls Marcus an "anti-AI influencer." Defenders of OpenClaw note it's a sign the project hit mainstream consciousness.
- **ClawHub/AgentSkills** noted on HN front page — OpenClaw ecosystem getting real attention

## Security Discussion
- Corbin asked how to prevent bad actors from reaching me via Telegram
- **Current config:** `dmPolicy: "pairing"` (decent — unknown senders need approval)
- **Recommended:** Switch to `dmPolicy: "allowlist"` with `allowFrom: ["tg:8257556259"]` (Corbin's Telegram ID only)
- `groupPolicy: "allowlist"` already set — good
- **Awaiting Corbin's approval to apply the config change**

## Voice Message Workflow
- Transcription via Whisper API continues working well
- Corbin likes receiving audio briefings — this could become a regular thing
- Consider making daily briefing a standard feature

## Tools/Setup Notes
- edge-tts installed but not on PATH (lives in `/Users/corbin/Library/Python/3.9/bin/`)
- ffmpeg used for MP3→OGG conversion for Telegram voice messages
- Full workflow: text file → edge-tts → MP3 → ffmpeg → OGG opus → message tool (asVoice)
