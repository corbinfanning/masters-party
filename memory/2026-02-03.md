# 2026-02-03 — Daily Notes

## Daily Audio Briefing
- Corbin requested a voice briefing covering news, Hacker News, markets, etc.
- Built ~4 min audio briefing using edge-tts (AndrewNeural voice) → OGG → Telegram voice message
- **TTS setup:** `edge-tts` installed at `/Users/corbin/Library/Python/3.9/bin/edge-tts` (not on PATH). Built-in `tts` tool failed ("edge: undefined"), so used edge-tts CLI directly.
- **Workflow:** Write text → edge-tts to MP3 → ffmpeg convert to OGG opus → send via message tool as voice

## Market Summary (Feb 3)
- S&P 500 down 0.84% to 6,917.81
- Nasdaq down 1.43% to 23,255.19
- Dow down 166.67 pts to 49,240.99
- **Software stocks hammered**: iShares Software ETF (IGV) down 5% today, 28% from high — AI disruption fears (companies using Claude Code etc. to build own software)
- Private credit firms (Blue Owl, TPG, Ares, KKR) down double digits
- Bitcoin lowest since Nov 2024 (~$73,800), down 15% YTD
- Walmart crossed $1T market cap
- PepsiCo cutting snack prices 15%

## Major News
- **SpaceX acquired xAI** — all-stock deal creating $1.25T private company (most valuable ever). Gets Grok, X platform. Plans for data centers in space.
- **Government shutdown ended** — House voted 217-214 to reopen, Trump signing immediately
- **France dumping Zoom/Teams** — Europe pushing digital sovereignty from US tech
- **Siemens Energy** committing $1B to US grid/turbine capacity for AI data center power
- **OpenAI launched Codex desktop app** — agentic coding on desktop
- **Apple Xcode 26.3** — agentic coding capabilities

## Hacker News Deep Dive (Corbin requested follow-up)
- **Agent Skills post (325 upvotes, 186 comments)**: agentskills.io — open standard from Anthropic. Debate about whether structured skill format matters vs plain documentation. HuggingFace researcher showed +6 HumanEval improvement on 0.6B model with skills. Key insight: "intelligence isn't just parameter count, it's context relevance."
- **OpenClaw ACM article (52 upvotes, 19 comments)**: Gary Marcus piece calling OpenClaw "a disaster waiting to happen." HN community largely shredding it — caught Marcus fabricating config details (wrong release date, deliberately misconfigured installation to create vulnerabilities, then "hacked" them). Top comment calls Marcus an "anti-AI influencer." Defenders of OpenClaw note it's a sign the project hit mainstream consciousness.
- **ClawHub/AgentSkills** noted on HN front page — OpenClaw ecosystem getting real attention

## Security Discussion
- Corbin asked how to prevent bad actors from reaching me via Telegram
- **Current config:** `dmPolicy: "pairing"` (decent — unknown senders need approval)
- **Recommended:** Switch to `dmPolicy: "allowlist"` with `allowFrom: ["tg:8257556259"]` (Corbin's Telegram ID only)
- `groupPolicy: "allowlist"` already set — good
- **Awaiting Corbin's approval to apply the config change**

## Voice Message Workflow
- Transcription via Whisper API continues working well
- Corbin likes receiving audio briefings — this could become a regular thing
- Consider making daily briefing a standard feature

## Equity & Career (Late Night Session ~2-3:30am)

### Equity Details
- **Thoma Bravo profits interests** — $3M targeted at 3x MoM return
- Boeing sold Jeppesen/ForeFlight to TB for **$10.55B** (announced Apr 2025, closed **Nov 12, 2025**)
- Letter from Brian Jaffee (Partner, Thoma Bravo) dated Aug 26, 2025
- 50% time-based vesting (25% at year 1, then monthly over 36 months)
- 50% performance-based (4 annual tranches, first period based on 2026 financials)
- **83(b) NOT filed** — window closed ~Dec 12, 2025. Relying on safe harbor.
- **No follow-up plan documents received** despite deal closing 3 months ago
- After-tax value at 3x: ~$2.29M (LTCG) or ~$1.78M (if ordinary income)
- At 2x: ~$1.14M. At 1x: **$0** (profits interests only pay above threshold)

### Role Change
- Moving FROM: Head of all ForeFlight Engineering (iOS, Server, Web)
- Moving TO: Leading Flight Deck backend services & web apps
- New scope: Jeppesen Ground Controls, Jeppesen FliteBrief, ForeFlight backend services (excl. platform/infra/DevOps/IAM), ForeFlight Web
- **Corbin is happy about this** — wants to focus, be more hands-on, get away from product team
- Very close with CPO and his boss (who reports to CPO). Boss consults him on personnel and equity decisions. High trust relationship.
- Assessment: Not a demotion if played right. Risk is becoming invisible. Keep wins visible.

### ForeFlight vs AI Disruption
- Aviation software well-protected: regulatory moat, data monopoly, safety-critical, high switching costs
- Real risk is PE math (can TB 3x a $10.55B investment?), not AI
- Software selloff (IGV -5%, -28% from highs) is about commodity software, not aviation

### Action Items Given to Corbin
1. Email HR about missing equity plan docs (URGENT)
2. Find PE tax attorney re: 83(b) and safe harbor (URGENT)
3. Check employment agreement for non-compete/IP/moonlighting clauses
4. Understand 2026 performance vesting triggers

## Golf Product Interest
- Corbin loves golf and wants to combine passion with software product development
- Discussed AI caddie/coach concepts — Corbin pushed back on "on-course" tools (people golf to get away from screens)
- Better angle: off-course experiences (before/after round, range, shopping, social)
- Still exploring — no commitment yet. Worth revisiting.

## Tools/Setup Notes
- edge-tts installed but not on PATH (lives in `/Users/corbin/Library/Python/3.9/bin/`)
- ffmpeg used for MP3→OGG conversion for Telegram voice messages
- Full workflow: text file → edge-tts → MP3 → ffmpeg → OGG opus → message tool (asVoice)
- **QMD memory backend enabled** — installed bun, qmd, configured in openclaw.json
- **OpenClaw updated to 2026.2.2-3** — had to manually clear npm stale dirs
